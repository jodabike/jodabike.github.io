*May 20*

We arrived in Quito at 6 am, local time, and so did our bikes and luggage. What a relieve! :) Our first challenge was to bring the bikes from the baggage claim to the outside area of the airport because a baggage cart costed 2 dollars and we did not have any cash yet. Luckily some friendly travelers recognized our struggle and gave us the money.

We unpacked and reassembled the bikes at the airport and had to find that the little bike pump we brought does not work.

Then we cycled to our first accommodation, about 30 km from the airport. Ah, wait, actually it was 50 km with a height difference of about 900m. :D

We went along the outskirts of Quito and it was a pretty exhausting ride (for Jo). But the surrounding landscape looked amazing.

Finally, we arrived at Sebastian's, who we met via warmshowers.org. He welcomed us warmly, gave us a wonderful room and shared some helpful bike travel experiences with us while eating out in a local restaurant.
