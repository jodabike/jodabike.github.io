*May 21 - May 24*

We spent another two days with Sebastian and we could not have had a better start for our tour. :) He took us to Quito to buy a new pump and had a wonderful music session with us. Also, he had cycled from Quito to Patagonia five years ago himself and gave us many many helpful tips!

Some impressions from the village:

On Thursday, we started cycling towards Cotopaxi, which is one of the highest active volcanos on Earth. We cycled upwards along a cobblestone path, passing mountain villages and fascinating forests. In the late afternoon, it started raining and did not stop until the next day, so we had to camp in the rain, but at least found a pretty good camping spot.

The next morning, we started cycling in the rain, but after a while, the sky cleared, the sun came out and we had a beautiful view on Cotopaxi and the surrounding landscape!

We could even dry our tent!  ;)

At the end of that beautiful day, we arrived in a small town and spent the night in a nice little guest house.
