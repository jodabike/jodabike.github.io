May 25 - May 27

On Saturday, May 25, we followed the Panamericana to Ambato. We arrived in this big and hilly city in the afternoon, not knowing where to spend the night yet.

By chance, we passed the local fire station and remembered that Sebastian had said, that fire fighters in South America are usually very friendly with travelers and host them. Hence, we just tried and asked them and were actually welcomed warmly and could spend the night in an empty conference room. As Jo's pedal was a bit broken, we went to the city a bit and by pure luck, actually found a shop where we could by a new one.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_2353.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-178" width="3024" height="4032">

The fire fighters had a street volleyball field in their backyard and David played a short game with them before we went to sleep. <img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_2360.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-176" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_2362.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-177" width="4032" height="3024">

In the night, we felt the Earth shaking, it was the big earth quake from Peru. The next morning, we started our way towards Chimborazo, the highest mountain of Ecuador. It was a cloudy day and it actually looked pretty foggy up in the mountains. <img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_2372.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-181" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_2365.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-182" width="4032" height="3024">It was a nice and exhausting ascent and in the afternoon we stopped in a little village looking for a place to spend the night. We were surrounded by curious people and they welcomingly shared their supper with us. But then, the sun finally came out and we decided to use the good weather and went on cycling a bit.

It was a cold and clear night up at 3900m altitude but we woke up to beautiful weather and sunshine. We went on our ascent having an amazing view on Chimborazo all day long.

Then, we had a nice long descent and ended up sleeping in Colta, where we were welcomed warmly again. We had the best view on Chimborazo! :)
