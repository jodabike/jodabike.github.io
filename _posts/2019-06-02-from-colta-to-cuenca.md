*May 28 - May 31*

On May 28, we went further south, mainly following the Panamericana, but also taking a nice detour on country roads. It was amazing to see the little towns along the road, the people were all really friendly and interested in our tour. Agriculture is also very fascinating here. The smallest and steepest fields are used for farming and most of the work is done by hand.

It was pretty foggy, but sometimes we had a nice view on the landscape.

Unfortunately it was pretty rainy that day.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/p1160441-1.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-213" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_2467-1.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-210" width="4032" height="3024">On May 31, we went towards Cuenca and followed the old railway path. It was a beautiful road through rural areas until we reached the city chaos of Cuenca which we luckily only bypassed.
