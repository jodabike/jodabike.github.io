June 1 - June 5

From Cuenca, we took a nice side road up in the mountains again to avoid the Panamericana for a while. We stopped for a delicious street food lunch where we could observe a pig being taken apart while eating.

It was sunny, cloudy, foggy, windy, warm, cold and in the afternoon, we got into a short heavy thunderstorm. Luckily we could seek shelter under a little roof in front of a school and even got company. :)<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_2498.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-230" width="4032" height="3024">

It got pretty "late" (it gets dark here at 6:30 pm, so everything up from them feels like deep night for us) and we had to ride a couple of hours through the dark. Finally we reached the hostel though where we were welcomed surprisedly and friendly. :) <img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_2522.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-229" width="4032" height="3024">On Sunday, we further followed hilly dirt roads, but luckily had pretty good weather that day, so that the roads were not too muddy.

Soils and rocks were really colorful here!
