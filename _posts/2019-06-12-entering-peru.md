*June 9 - June 11*

On Sunday, June 9, we crossed the boarder from Ecuador to Peru in La Balsa. It was pretty chaotic, because we did not find the right offices right away and had to go back an forth between Ecuador and Peru two times. But, finally we managed to officially exit Ecuador and enter Peru!

At the Peruvian side, the street was asphalted again so we could comfortably ride to the next little town, Namballe, where we spent the night in a hostel.

We passed San Ignacio in the afternoon, rode on and had dinner in a nice little family restaurant at the side of the road. They even let us camp in their sheds. :)

Tuesday was incredibly hot and we rode through a flat valley alongside a river to Jaén. We passed countless rice fields, banana fields and even ananas fields.
