*June 17 - June 22*

After a day of relaxing in Celendín on Sunday, June 16, we continued our way towards direction of Cajamarca on Monday. We had to cross another pass at 3750 m through some rain clouds that were stuck at the top of the mountain.

On the other side of the pass, the sun slowly made its way through the clouds (or we slowly made our way out of the clouds).

Some kilometers before Cajamarca, we turned to a smaller road, passing Polloc, where we stopped at a beautiful mosaic church.

We camped next to the road shortly after Polloc.

The next morning, we further headed south.

Shortly after passing San Marcos, we met two other cyclists on their way to Ushuaia: Alexandra and Anthony. We cycled together for a while, exchanged some experiences and route ideas and had lunch together. :)

Then, we went on to Cajabamba where we spent the night in a nice hostel. That day, we cycled 100 km, our longest distance so far (even though the distance does not tell everything about the potential exertion because altitude gain and road conditions also play crucial roles).

We spent the next morning in the hostel, relaxing a bit from the previous long day. Then, we wandered through Cajabamba for about two hours looking for an ATM and supplies, especially bread which was pretty hard to find somehow. But we finally found some really good bread on the market. :)

So, we left the town in the afternoon and only cycled a short passage until we found a good camp site.

On Thursday we headed towards a 4100 m pass. It was a nice and quite road and we stopped by a beautiful lake in the morning.

Little girl herding sheep. Or just chasing and running around with them, we were not sure. ;)

Higher up, the landscape got wilder and more lonely.

Water filtration.

We reached the top of the pass in the late afternoon, crossed it and slept right behind the top in a wind shelter. It was still pretty windy and cold that night.

The next day, our way lead us through the beautiful high land for a while.

We could see several mines from there, the landscape around us was pretty much full of them.

Then, we started our downhill ride on a rough dirt road. We let out some air of our tires to have better grip.

We camped about halfway down of this descent.

Saturday, we directly passed one old mine in the morning. It is shocking to see how badly these mines destroy the beautiful landscape. (Ironically we say this, taking pictures of the mines with our phones that consist of materials taken from such mines.)

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3102.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-468" width="4032" height="3024">As you can see, David pimped his bike equipment: in addition to his great antenna, he now also carries a practical feather duster around with him. ;)<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3108.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-469" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_4138.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-490" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_4150.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-470" width="4032" height="3024">

The dirt roads were incredibly dusty and trailers from the mines passed regularly, swirling up the dust badly.

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3111.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-471" width="4032" height="3024">

We passed two little towns later that day: Santa Clara de Tulpo, which resembled a ghost town and Mollebamba where we had lunch and could buy some supplies.

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_4177.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-472" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3114.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-473" width="4032" height="3024">

Some kilometers after Mollebamba, a part of the road got renewed.

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_4188.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-474" width="4032" height="3024"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_4196.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-475" width="4032" height="3024">

Further down, the road surprisingly was asphalted again so we wanted to pump up our deflated tires again... and had to find that the new pump we bought in Quito does not work! So, we lost more air out of our tires trying several ways to pump them up. Rolling downhill, we had a short moment of hope, seeing a motorcycle with a pump parked at the road.

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/image-12.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-476" width="4032" height="3024">

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3117.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-477" width="4032" height="3024">

We asked a guy on the road if we could use the pump and he actually knew and called the owner of the motorbike and told us to wait for him. So, we waited for the owner, but as he did not show up after 15 minutes, we gave up our hope again and rode on with our flat tires.

But soon, the asphalt ended again anyway and we reached an even bigger construction site: the whole lower part, that leads into the valley, got renewed.

We passed a camp of street workers and asked them for air. They were super nice and actually pumped up our tires (taking air out of one of their tractors' tires). :)

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_3121.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-480" width="3394" height="2448">

Further down on this road under construction, a truck passed us, watering the dusty road... and turning it into mud.

So, after a day of various road conditions, we reached Rio Conchucos down in the valley in the evening and camped next to the river.
