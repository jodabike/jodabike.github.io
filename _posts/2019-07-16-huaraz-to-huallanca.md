*July 10 - July 12*

We left our hostel on Wednesday morning after the hostel owner gave us a bunch of herbs of his garden which help against stomach pain and having a long chat with his two really nice and interested kids.

As Jo was not 100% fit yet, we only rode a short asphalt distance that day.

We had dinner at a cozy restaurant with good mountain view and could set up our tent next to it.

The next morning, we turned to a dirt road to go over some beautiful passes again. It was a lonely road, except for about 20 tourist busses that passed us in the morning to bring tourists from Huaraz to the Pastoruri glacier. A glacier that has shrunk to less than one third of the size it had in 1980 and will probably not be there anymore in 20 years.

We took a break in the middle of nowhere, when suddenly the sweetest little lamb appeared out of the grassland, came running towards us and jumped right into our arms.

At the entrance of the national park, the guards were happy that we brought the lamb with us and prepared some milk for it right away. They knew the farmer and would bring the little guy back to its mum soon.

We rode on through the national park and passed the funniest looking plants.

On our way, we met two friendly German cyclists, on their way through South America as well, and had a long chat with them (They also have a blog: rumradeln.de). Then we rode on through the beautiful park and set up camp in the evening.

We passed the Pasturori glacier, but only looked at it from the far distance as there is not much to see anymore and we had plenty of other beautiful glaciers around us.

Shortly after, we reached an amazing high plateau at about 4700 m on which we cycled along for the rest of the day.

And we know, we say this a lot, but as so often up there in the Andes, the view was amazing! :)

And the mountains were wonderfully colorful!

We descended again in the afternoon.

One selfie before hit civilization again.

We finally rode through a valley to Huallanca, which was full of mines again.
