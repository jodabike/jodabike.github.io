July 13 - July 16

From Huallanca, we rode further through the narrow valley until we reached La Unión.

Then, we went uphill again and followed the way on a high plateau for a while.

In the late afternoon, we met Lucy with her lovely dog Wombat. She is an Australian young woman walking from Ushuaia to Alaska. A project which probably takes 5 years, wow! (Her website: tanglesandtail.com) We spent a wonderful afternoon with her and set up camp together.

On Sunday, Lucy went further north while we further headed towards the opposite direction.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_4976.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-829" width="2959" height="2521"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_4034.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-828" width="4032" height="3024">

In the middle of the day, we stopped in Baños for lunch and resupply.

And at the end of a cloudy day of cycling, we camped next to the road. <img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_5009.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-830" width="3775" height="2832"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_5019.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-832" width="4032" height="3024">

The next day, we cycled over another pass and passed some beautiful lakes.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190164.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-833" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190175.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-834" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190187.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-835" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190213.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-836" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190216.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-838" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190222.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-837" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190232.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-839" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190256.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-841" width="4608" height="3456">

In the afternoon, it started to hail. Luckily, we just came through a little village, which was not even mentioned on our maps, where we could seek shelter under a little roof.

As the sun was still shining while it hailed, we hoped that the weather would get better again soon... but it got worse and worse.

Hence, we went to the big town hall, where the whole town was gathered in some kind of conference.

<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_4048.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-842" width="4032" height="3024"> Unfortunately, our Spanish is not good enough yet, to really understand what they were negotiating. But we could come in to seek shelter from the hail and rain and wait until the end of the conference. Meanwhile, about 20 curious town kids gathered around our bikes and came to shake our hands. It was quite a weird situation, but in the end, we were offered to camp in the town hall and we were really thankful for that option.

(They had forgotten the weirdest looking cake in the hall. :D)

It was still cold the next morning and it had snowed during the night on the mountain tops around us. But luckily, it had stopped raining and snowing and for a while, the sun even came out. So, we started early to cross another 4800 m high pass.

We passed further beautiful lakes.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190263.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-849" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190265.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-852" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190270.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-850" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190276.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-853" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190282.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-854" width="4608" height="3456">

The higher we came, the colder it got and at some point we found ourselves in the snow. And then we reached another mine.

Countless mine trucks passed us, turned the road into a mud hole and speckled us with mud. (We don't know what they exactly mine up there, but gold is possible and sounded best in the title. ;))

It really was no fun to cross that pass, but on the way down, the road and the weather got better and so did our moods.

We enjoyed being warmed up by the sun and descended to Oyon, a small city where we spent the night.<img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190452.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-869" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190427.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-870" width="4608" height="3456"><img src="https://ohwieschoenistpatagonia.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/p1190442.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-871" width="4608" height="3456">
