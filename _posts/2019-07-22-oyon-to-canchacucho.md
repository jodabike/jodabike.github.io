*July 17 - July 19*

From Oyon, we headed towards another 4800 m pass. The first part of the road was closed, but we decided to try it anyway.

Luckily, we could pass the landslide that blocked the road with our bikes.

And in case, you ever wondered, what happens to the waste here, we found the answer.

The next big part of the road was under construction and full of big trucks again.

But the road condition was good and the construction workers extremely friendly. They gave us two warm spare lunches when we passed and it was one of the best meals we had so far!

One of the trucks was stuck in a curve, so we had to wait for about half an hour until we could pass. The mine workers were really friendly again, but it was freezing cold.

Finally, we reached the top of the pass, when David’s circuit shifter broke. It was pretty much the worst time and place where this could have happened, because we were freezing cold already from the waiting and it was windy, muddy and below zero degrees up there.

We thus rolled downhill for a while but soon had to push our bikes because the road lead slightly uphill again.

It was a short ride of no more than 3 km, but it felt incredibly good to warm up a bit in the heated bus. At their base camp, the workers had lunch and we could fix David’s bike, protected from the wind and with the help of some tools of their mechanic. We were a little attraction for the street workers. :)

Luckily David had the right spare part with him and could fix the shifter, so that we could soon get on with our way. We even had a little sunshine in the afternoon.

It was a cold night again, especially for David, whose sleeping bag does not really isolate anymore and whose sleeping matt additionally lost its air that night. So, we had really hoped for some sunshine in the next morning, but Peru's dry season disappointed us again and we woke up by rain drops drizzling on our tent. It stopped again after a while, but the whole morning was stormy, cold and it rained from time to time again.

We then went for a little detour towards the national park Huallay in Canchacucho, where rocks build crazy formations (see next blog post).
