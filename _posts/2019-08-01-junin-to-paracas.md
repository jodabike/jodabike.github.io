July 22 - July 27

Some weeks ago, we camped on some farmers‘ land who proudly told us that Peru's landscape has it all: mountains, desert, rain forest and the sea. But since we arrived in Peru, we have not left the beautiful Andes yet. Hence, we decided to see a little more of this land’s diversity and aim towards the ocean and see some desert as well. This enabled us some pretty relaxing days of rolling downhill.

On Monday when we left Junín, we cycled about 100 km slightly downhill, mainly on asphalt.

We passed La Oroya, a city with a huge mining industry, where pretty much all mountains are. It was fascinating and scary at the same time.

After a short visit in San Francisco in the late afternoon, we left the asphalt again and set up camp in the fields.

The next day, we wanted to cross one last 4600 m pass before the big ascent to the ocean. Unfortunately, Jo had a bad migraine and we came not very far. We set up camp at noon and chilled for the rest of the day. Which was actually a quite good thing to do, because a thunderstorm and some heavy rain came up in the afternoon.

It got pretty cold that night.

So, we tackled the pass one day later and even though it was not far, it was pretty exhausting to get over it. The road was steep and stony and we had to push through some parts.

On our way down, we started to follow Rio Cañete, the river that we would follow until the Pacific Ocean.

On Thursday, we further followed the beautiful valley.

The landscape got drier and the road got bigger and more busy. The valley was pretty touristic at some parts. Therefore we wanted to take a smaller side road for the last 30 km to the coast. When we wanted to turn to that smaller road, we stood in front of a huge fruit plantation and the owners said that there was no road to the coast here. They said, the way would be a path where we would have to carry our bikes and that we should better take the big road. But we stubbornly convinced them, that our map showed a road and we wanted to try it. So, they shook their shoulders and let us pass.
Firstly, we rode through the huge fruit plantation of mandarins and avocados.

Then, we reached some cliffs with only a small path and we actually had to carry our bikes.

Another avocado plantation followed and it looked like the path would not go on at all.... maybe we should have listened to the men at the entrance. :D
David went for a little exploration walk and luckily went far enough to see that the path goes on and gets bigger again after another 3 km.

So, finally we made it to a road like we had imagined it from the map! It lead us through deserts and vast fruit plantations and fields.

(In case you were wondering where to put your waste in the desert: just put it in the green bin!)

We found a camp spot on an empty field close to the coast in the evening.

We had been looking forward to some hot and sunny days at the sea, but when we woke up the next morning, it was grey, foggy and slightly drizzling.

First view on the Pacific Ocean! Wow!

We came to the Panamericana, the big highway that leads through North and South America, and had to follow it for about 60 km.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/sndpf9i14zd4nm6/Foto%2027.07.19%2C%2012%2011%2008.jpg?dl=0

The highway has a big shoulder to cycle on, but it is still loud, dangerous and no fun. In addition, the shoulder is full of fragments, broken car parts and dead animals and it was a constant slalom ride.

After 20 km on that road, David got a pretty bad cut in his tire. Our first flat tire after about 3000 km of cycling!

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8kky8e8oirlaf6p/Foto%2027.07.19%2C%2009%2004%2050.jpg?dl=0

Another 20 km later, we stopped at a gas station to fully pump up the fixed tire again. And however that was possible, David’s rim exploded.

We were shocked and pretty happy that nothing had happened to David. But we could definitely not go on like this anymore and started to think where we might get a new rim and how we could get there. It was a pretty desperate situation and we started to imagine that we probably had to hitchhike to Pisco, the next bigger city ahead of us and take a bus north to Lima to find a proper bike shop. It would be some really annoying days with a lot of bike carrying... While we were thinking about our situation, the manager of the gas station, Percy, had spotted us and started to make phone calls. He had been a cyclist himself when he was younger and somehow really wanted to help us, which was the best thing that could could have happened to us! Soon, he had talked to a guy from a bike shop who had a new rim in store. He offered us, to lock our bikes in the gas station and bring us to the bike shop, about 30 km north of us. We agreed and 30 minutes later, we sat at lunch in Chincha while the back wheel got fixed in the nearby bike shop (Percy even invited us for lunch!).

Afterwards Percy also organized a taxi for us that brought us back to the gas station, he really was our hero! Thank you so much!

Thus, we were standing at the gas station about two hours later again, put in the fixed wheel and it was as if nothing had happened. and the sun finally came out! :)
Still a bit puzzled, we went on with our route towards Pisco and Paracas.

We arrived in Paracas in the evening and wanted to look for a hostel. But it was one day before the Peruvian national reunion celebration day and the prices were three to five times as high as they usually are... So we camped at the beach.
