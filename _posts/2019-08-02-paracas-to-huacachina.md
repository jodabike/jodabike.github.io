July 28 - July 31

We spent a relaxed Sunday morning in Paracas, trying out tasty Tamal for breakfast (sustainably wrapped in banana leaves).

And then we rode into the desert.

We had some pretty strong headwind, so we did not make many kilometers that day. It was incredibly exhausting but also really fascinating to ride through this vast void.

The next day, we rode more towards direction of east instead of south, so we had strong wind coming from our right instead of our front. It was a little better but partly the wind also got so strong that it got nearly impossible to cycle.

Luckily, the wind got weaker in the afternoon and we could enjoy the vastness and the bumpy, sandy, lonely roads.

On Tuesday, we only had a short ride left until Ica.

We firstly went to a bike shop again because Davidâ€™s back wheel had a slight eight since the exchange and did not roll properly.

Unfortunately, the guy in the shop was not too motivated to help us and could not really fix the problem. Afterwards, we went to a nice hostel in the oasis next to Ica, Huacachina. It was great to relax a bit after some exhausting days in the desert.

We stayed in the oasis for another day and went to Ica again on Wednesday to wash our clothes and give the bike fix another chance at another shop. This time it worked! :)

For the rest of the day, we organized some stuff and relaxed.
