*August 5 - August 9*

On Monday morning, we found a little bike shop in Puquio where we could borrow some tools to fix Jo’s front wheel.

Then, we further followed the nice PE-30A, the road which we were following since it’s start in Nazca. It lead uphill again.

We camped on 4100 m and enjoyed the warming sun during breakfast the next morning.

The road lead further uphill to a large high plateau on about 4500 m which we rode along on Tuesday.

We tried Sanky fruits which are advertised to be extremely healthy. And as they taste really sour, we believe they must contain at least a lot of vitamin C.

We had dinner in a little restaurant in Pampamarca.

This is how restaurants often look like here: pretty dark, a TV is running, it is a bit chaotic and the food is cheap and good.

Afterwards, we went to a house outside the village where we could spend the night. It was some kind of state-supported shelter and we were really happy to spend a warm night there. A lovely woman with her little kids managed the house and also spent the night there.

At these altitudes, the temperature highly varies between day and night. It usually freezes during the night and as soon as the sun comes out, it gets really warm. (We often only wear long sleeves to avoid sun burns, not because we are cold.) Hence, we could warm up in the morning sun during breakfast, being surrounded by fluffy alpacas.

David eats bread with honey and the honey here tastes amazingly fruity!

We further followed PE-30A on the high plateau and crossed a last little pass before the road lead slightly downhill for about 200 km.

On top, we stopped to put on our jackets and had our first negative experience with a Peruvian. A man approached us and asked for food and we wanted to give him some sweets. But he did not want them, he demanded bread and then money and started to grab the backs of our bikes. He got really unfriendly and intrusive, tried to open our bags and did not want to let us got. We managed to get away hearing him shout after us but luckily nothing had happened. Happy to have a long descent ahead of us, we soon had left the man far behind us. It was a weird feeling because all Peruvians we had met so far were extremely friendly but as so often, exceptions confirm the rules. ;)

We camped at the beach of Rio Apurima and unfortunately Jo got some problems with her stomach again during the night. This time, it probably was a little water poisening.

Therefore, we did not get too far the next day but it was still a nice day.

On Friday, we tackled the last view kilometers to Abancay.
