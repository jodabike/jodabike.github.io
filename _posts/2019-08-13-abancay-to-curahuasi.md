August 10 - August 13

We went to see another bike shop on Saturday morning because the ball bearing of Jo’s front wheel still made some troubles. Soon, we probably know every bike shop in southern Peru. :D

The shop was run by a lovely family, a mother and her two sons, and was really busy with Peruvians that mainly came to get their kids’ bikes fixed. The young guy first tried to fix the ball bearing but found that the ball shell was broken and did not have a spare.

Hence, he had to exchange the whole wheel hub and the spokes. The centering of the wheel took hours because we wanted to have it done properly after the troubles we had had with David’s back wheel. Around lunch time, we got served a tasty lunch that the shop lady had prepared.

And as it got later and later, she also kindly offered us to stay the night at her place. She had a spare room which she wants to turn into a “casa de ciclistas” soon anyway. Happily, we agreed and spent the night at the top floor of a busy Peruvian multi family house after a whole day at the bike shop. Many kids were running around there and eagerly wanted to be taught english words by us.

On Sunday, we did our first short WWOOF visit and went to see Harol at his place. He welcomed us warmly and we went to see his farm in the afternoon. It is an organic agroecology project with many great ideas and plans.

In the evening, we sat together with the whole family, ate pancakes and had a nice music session.

Unfortunately, we could not stay longer at this inspiring place because we were heading for Cusco but it was a great experience!
Hence, we started our way towards Cusco the next morning after a little supply shopping tour in hilly Abancay.
We rode uphill along a nice road until we found a camp site in the evening.

That night, the water poisening hit David and he felt really bad the next day. Therefore, we only rode a short distance the next day and went to a hostel on Curahuasi after we had crossed the pass.

We have tickets to visit Machu Picchu next monday and quite some distance to pass to reach it... let's see if that works out!
