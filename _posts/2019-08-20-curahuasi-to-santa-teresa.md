*August 14 - August 17*

We were both feeling very sick and David was especially weak because he could neither eat nor drink. So, we decided to go to the hospital on Wednesday.
<!--more-->
It was a big modern hospital founded by Germans. Thus, many Germans were working there and a German nurse took care of us which made the communication really easy. However, we were examined only shortly by a doctor, diagnosed with a stomach infection and got prescribed a bunch of antibiotics and pills. We also both got an infusion to regain strength and with medicals against pain and nausea.

So, we went home in the afternoon, feeling a little better and with a bag full of pills (which we mostly decided not to take as we are no friends of taking antibiotics especially not even being sure what we had). In the evening we felt so good again that we yielded to our cravings and went to eat pizza. Our stomachs were so perplex that they actually took it well. :D

Our plan to cycle all the way to Machu Picchu until Monday could not work out anymore after these days of illness. Hence, we looked for a bus or taxi to take us to the starting point of the Salkantay trek. And we actually found a taxi driver who was crazy enough to squeeze our bikes in the back of his little car and drove us up the narrow dirt road serpentines to Salkantay.

Our bikes survived the bumpy ride without damages and were just covered with dust at the end.

Then, we passed many tourist camps and found our own nice camp site at the beginning of the trek.

Beautiful first view on the Salkantay in the evening light.

The next day, Friday, was probably the most exhausting day of our tour so far, even though we only covered a distance of less than 10 km. The Salkantay trek is a pretty steep and rocky hiking trail, so we had to push and carry our bikes uphill for about 800 m of altitude.

The Salkantay trek is a popular tourist hiking trail to get to Machu Picchu, so we were passed by many hikers in the morning and even more horses and mules that carried the touristsâ€™ luggage or the tourists themselves (no matter how small the mule and how big the tourist).

It was incredibly exhausting but the views were wonderful.

For the last 500 m, which were really steep, we got help from two amazing Swiss guys who pushed the bikes uphill with us, so that we reached the top of the pass at over 4600 m shortly after noon.

We also met a two nice couples at the top of the pass, Greek and Italian, so it was a bit of a European gathering up there.

Their guide was fascinated by our bikes.

Then, we started our descent which was also not easy. The path was still so rocky and steep that we had the push the bikes for most parts.

The Incas knew about the principle of wheels but never used them. Now, we understand why.

On Saturday morning, we let the sun warm us up and then continued our way down.

We reached the end of the Salkantay trek in the early afternoon. Here, a pretty decent dirt road started towards Santa Teresa.

Santa Teresa is the town from where we wanted to start our hike to Machu Picchu and we arrived at a nice hostel, whose owners also sold great honey, in the evening.
