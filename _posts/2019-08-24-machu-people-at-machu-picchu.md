*August 18 - August 19*

We could leave our luggage in the hostel and rode with light bikes towards Machu Picchu.

After about 10 km, we had to leave the bikes at the checkpoint at the beginning of the train that leads to Machu Picchu. The guy at the checkpoint was really friendly and let us put the bikes in his little cabin for free.

From there, we hiked another 10 km along the railways to Aguas Calientes, or else, Machu Picchu Pueblo.

Aguas Calientes is a crazily touristic town which consists of nothing but overpriced tourist restaurants, souvenir shops and hostels. We spent the afternoon in town and a short night in a hostel.

Our alarm was set to 3 a.m. and we started hiking uphill to Machu Picchu half an hour later. We had thought the hike would take us at least 2.5 hours but we arrived at the entrance gate a good hour later at 4:40 a.m. We were the first and only ones in line.... for about an hour. :D And we did not even have the 6 a.m. tickets, but 7 a.m. tickets.

At 5:40 a.m. the tourist busses arrived and a long line was formed behind us. (Every hour from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., 800 tourists enter Machu Picchu.)

But of course, we did not get in at 6 and had to wait another hour until we could enter.

We first walked up to the sun gate from which we had a nice view on the whole site.

The terraces were used for agricultural purposes and also provided landslides. We thought that they would make a pretty good camp site nowadays. ;)

Then, we visited the Inca bridge which connects the break in an Inca trail along a steep rock wall with wood logs. In case of an attack, the wood logs could be thrown down so that the entrance to Machu Picchu from this side was not possible anymore.

Pretty fascinating that the Inca had actually built a trail along this wall! It is still recognizable as the green line of plants.

Next, we went into the city. A lot of the stone walls are rebuilt to give visitors a better impression of the looks of the place. However, the original walls are well recognizable and look amazing. They are ground very precisely, fit perfectly within the walls and hold together without any mortar.

All in all, we were fascinated by this place but the masses of tourists and the big hype around it took away a bit of its magic.

After four hours, we left Machu Picchu again, descended and walked back long the railways to our bikes.

Tired, hubgry and happy, we arrived in Santa Teresa where we spent another night in the honey hostel.
