August 20 - August 24

Tuesday, we first rode downhill on a dirt road to Santa Maria. The valley was nice but it was crazily dusty when cars passed us. It lead right into the jungle and everything was full of banana, lemon, orange and avocado trees, colorful insects and funnily sounding birds.

Then, we were back on asphalt on the road to Cusco trough the „sacred valley“. Another 4300 m high pass lay ahead of us (starting from 1100 m), so we started the ascent in the afternoon.

In the evening, we passed a village where some friendly women that sold fruits at the side of the road, gave us a bunch of fruits for free and said that we could camp on the town’s central park.

In the afternoon we had lunch at an amazing street restaurant, lead by a lovely woman who cooked very tasty food.

It rained during the night and was incredibly foggy the next day. Hence, the last part of our ascent on Thursday was damp, cold and without any view on the surrounding mountains.

We reached the top of the pass in the early afternoon and began a cold and wet descent.

Luckily, the clouds loosened up after a while and we reached Ollantaytambo in the evening.

The next day, we headed towards the salt terraces of Maras.

In these “salinas de Maras”, salt is gained by evaporation of salty water from a well in the mountains.

Afterwards, we cycled on for a bit until we reached a nice lake where we could camp.

From this lake, it was not far until Cusco anymore and we reached the colorful city around noon on Saturday.

We headed towards San Jeronimo, a quarter in the outskirts of Cusco, where we were welcomed warmly by the nuns who take care of Cusco’s school of the blind that was founded by Jo’s grandfathher.
