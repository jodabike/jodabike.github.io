August 25 - September 08

Jo‘s grandfather Franz Saxler had been a teacher for blind children for many years and also directed the school of blinds and visual impaired people in Neuwied for 18 years. 
<!--more-->
After his retirement in 1988 he dedicated himself to a school project in Cusco and started to gather donations with the help of several engaged fellows and the association for the care of blind and visually impaired children (VBBSK). He finally could buy a property in Cusco and organized the foundation of a school. In 1995 the opening of the school “Nuestra Señora del Carmen” for blind and visual impaired children was celebrated and it developed into a school for visual impairment, deaf-blindness and multidisability over the years. It is lead by Franciscan nuns until today.

We had the wonderful opportunity to visit this school for a couple of days and found accommodation at the lovely sisters Dilcia and Edith. (Thanks a lot again, Mr. Küster, for making the contact possible!) Two Spanish women, Fanny and Mila, and a German girl, Anne, also lived there for several months to help teaching and caring for the school kids. It was a fantastic group of people, full of love, joy, humor and interesting ideas and we had a great time together.

On Sunday, we went to explore the city center with Anne for a bit and went shopping at colorful, busy markets.

Then, we took part in the school every day life and helped taking care of the kids. It was an exhausting morning but the joy of these kids and the loving ambient at the school was a wonderful experience.

Some of the schools’ alumni come to an intern bakery every Tuesday and Thursday. We visited the bakery the next morning and also got shown around the whole school terrain by sister Dilcia. It is a big terrain with many little projects that still need to be done.

Wednesday morning was no school because of a teachers’ conference and we celebrated “Pago a la Pachamama (madre tierra)” with the teachers. It is an ancient Andean ritual to thank Mother Earth for all she gives and to give something back to her. Therefore, a variety of foods, drinks and coca leaves with good wishes for everybody get packed as a gift and sacrificed. This means it gets burned in a hole in the ground.

And as showing thankfulness feels great, Anne, David and Jo spent the rest of the day baking cookies for the nuns to thank them for their hospitality (and because it was fun).

In the afternoon, we went through all of our luggage an reviewed what we actually needed and what was just extra weight. Hence, we sorted out some stuff and gave it to the school.

And by the way, speaking of extra weight: David's favorite souvenirs are stones that he collects along the way.

Friday was the holiday of Santa Rosa and no school as well. In the morning, we packed gift bags for the school kids that had been sponsored by the two Spanish women Fany and Mila.

Saturday afternoon, we went for a little excursion with the whole group. We went to see beautiful churches and an archeological site and to eat ice cream. What a nice day!

We spent some more relaxing days in Cusco with trips to the city center, school visits, learning Spanish, some organizational stuff and enjoying the good time with the incredibly nice people here!

Fany also sewed a great sleeping bag for us out of beautiful Peruvian fabrics. David can use this now as addition to his normal sleeping bag.

Another reason for our long stay was that we waited for a package from Germany with some spare bike parts. It took way longer to reach Cusco than DHL had promised (4 weeks instead of 7-10 days) and we also had our troubles picking it up at the local post office Serpost. The Serpost staff was really unfriendly and we had to go there pretty often until we could finally take the package home.

But, in the end, it worked out, we could pick up the package, exchange our back tires with new Schwalbe Marathon tires (thanks to which we had only one flat tire riding over 4000 km on dirt roads, broken asphalt and lots of glass fragments) and get back on the road on Sunday morning.

It was a wonderfully pleasant time in Cusco. For two weeks, we could really feel home and take a break from cycling. A big thanks to sisters Dilcia and Edith who welcomed and hosted us so kindly! :)
