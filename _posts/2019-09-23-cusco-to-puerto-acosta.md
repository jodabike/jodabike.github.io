*September 09 - September 14*

We actually did not leave Cusco on Sunday as we had planned because we spent the whole day looking for a flight home in December.

<!--more-->

The two German cyclists Hannah and Marius had also planned to leave Cusco on Sunday but postponed to Monday and thanks to this lucky coincidence, we met each other on the road shortly after leaving the city and cycled together for a few days. Hanna and Marius, like us, started cycling in Quito and are heading to São Paolo in Brasil (their blog: cyclingcountrycollectors.com).

That day, we followed the nicely flat PE-3S road for about 70 km and enjoyed the company of the two others. It was nice to exchange experiences, discover similarities and differences and learn from each other.

On Tuesday we rode on together.

We camped at a hot spring bath and warmed up in the steaming water under the starry sky before we went to bed. :)

On Wednesday, we covered quite a long distance of more than 110 km on the slightly falling road.

We slept in a nice little hostel with a good restaurant, but unfortunately only cold showers.

We further approached lake Titicaca on the following day, but did not catch a look at it yet.

Kids and locals were pretty fascinated by our bikes.

We had a cozy dinner in a ruin and camped behind it.

On Friday, we finally had a first glimpse at lake Titicaca!

The weather was windy and quite unstable that day and we sought shelter under a little roof at noon as it looked like some heavy rain was approaching... But, instead the sun came out again. :)

Two other cyclists passed by: a German girl who cycles the world (her blog: luisarische.blog) traveling together with a French guy that she met in Uyuni. We had a good talk before we went on.

And with some delay, the heavy rain finally hit us in the afternoon. Luckily, we were not far from a town called Moho where we hoped to sleep in a hotel. But, when we arrived, the only hotel in town was fully booked because of a local holiday. The whole town was celebrating a big fiesta with parades, live music, dances, street food and, of course, loud fireworks.

Hence, we went to a restaurant to warm up for a bit at least. The restaurant had a big garage next to it and so, we asked the friendly owner of we could camp in there because it was getting dark already. “Normal” he answered shortly and shook his shoulders as if it was self-evident and no question that we could camp here. :)

With wonderful views on lake Titicaca, we cycled on the next day until we reached Tilali where we checked out of Peru.

Afterwards, we finally crossed the border to Bolivia in the middle of nowhere. The asphalted road ended and we were back on gravel.

About 30 km later, we arrived in Puerto Acosta, where we got our passport stamps in a tiny bureau.

As it was getting dark already, we went to one of the two hostels in town. And even though its name was promising - it was called 5 de noviembre, just like Jo’s birthday - the owners were pretty unfriendly and the promised warm showers were cold.

But we also had our first really good experiences in Bolivia that evening. We had dinner in a cozy little restaurant where we ate tasty fried cheese and got company by some friendly locals.

After dinner, we bought a local SIM card to receive mobile internet in Bolivia where WiFi is not that abundant anymore. An incredibly friendly woman in a little shop helped us through the rather complicated registration and installation process. (Unfortunately, the only network provider, Tigo, we could get in town had a pretty bad network coverage in the jungle as we should find out later.)
