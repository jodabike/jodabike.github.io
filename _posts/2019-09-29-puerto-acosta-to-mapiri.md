September 15 - September 19

After cold shower in the morning and some shopping on the market in Puerto Acosta, we hit the dirt road again. (As in every little South American town, there was some kind of fiesta going on here as well.)

We were heading to the jungle (Hannah and Marius had decided to make a jungle tour with us), but we had to get over some high mountains first. Hence, we let lake Titicaca behind us and cycled through beautiful lonely mountain landscapes.

A local Bolivian guy with a pretty cool bike rode with us for a short while.

The road conditions as well as the weather were mixed.

Sandwich break with company. :)

In the evening we found an abandoned house where we could camp, protected from wind, fog and cold.

On Monday, we cycled on through the wild mountain region and were happy to find a little town to refill water and supplies around noon.

Shortly after, we had a coffee break where we discussed the progress of our route and the cutest dog joined us.

After many locals had assured us that the road conditions of Davidâ€™s planned route were fine, we agreed to take it together and even the dog was convinced and followed us.

We camped on 4560 m altitude protected from the wind behind a house. At least we thought so, but the wind turned during the night and it got pretty cold. And in spite of the freezing cold up there, our dog slept next to our tents and protected us from other dogs. (I guess, the other dogs would not have noticed us without him, but he did a good job chasing them away.)

The next morning, we were all pretty frozen, but luckily the sun came out soon. We had to pass two more passes of about 4800 m altitude before our descent to the jungle. It was exhausting, but incredibly beautiful up there!

Many people in the little towns we passed do not even speak Spanish in this area here. They only speak Quechua, the native Andean language, so the communication was often challenging. We also felt a bit like aliens, as people often stared at us as if we had come from another planet with our weird looking bikes. But, in such a remote area, where usually no tourists pass by, we must have been a spectacular change from every day life.

In the evening, we reached a nice little town where we had dinner, got some resupply and could camp on the football field.

Wednesday, we cycled mostly downhill (except for some exhausting, steep climbing parts in between) on bumpy, stony dirt roads. It was amazing the see the landscape changing from bleak high mountains into greener vegetation and livelier nature.

Unfortunately, we got too fast for our little companion and had to leave him back at some point. We just hope, he will find some other nice people to take care of him or that he manages to further take care of himself!

We camped at a dry field down in the river valley.

On Thursday, we had to ride about 80 more kilometers to reach Mapiri. We had planned to make a boat tour from Guanay on the 21st and were a bit in a hurry.

It was a beautiful road through the jungle along the river, but it was also hot and hilly.

With the right amount of beer, we had the power to make quite some kilometers.

Ok, actually, a drunken local gave us two beer and we gathered empty cans along the road that he had thrown out of his car window.

In the afternoon, we realized that we would not make it in time to Mapiri and so we hitchhiked to Santa Rosa de Mapiri, a town close to Mapiri. We were lucky that a big pick up could take us there and it was an adventurous ride!

From Santa Rosa de Mapiri we had to puzzle the bikes into a taxi and we finally made it to town in the late evening.
