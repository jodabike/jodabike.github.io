September 20 - September 22

Friday morning, we got up very early and went to the port of Mapiri. We had asked many locals about a boat to Guanay but had not gotten any reliant information.

Hence, we asked some locals to get a boat ride and finally met the nicest guy. Alain offered to ship us to Guanay and also made us a great offer for a following jungle trip to Rurrenabaque with a friend. (His contact: Alain Tellez +59176588724)

Half an hour later, our bikes and stuff were packed on a little boat and we set off to the jungle on Rio Kaka (that turns into Rio Beni at some point).

The landscape could have been beautiful, but unfortunately the river was full of ugly gold mines that pollute the river and the environment. There were big mines as well as single people digging for gold in the brown water.

We took a refreshing break in a side arm of the river.

After about four hours, we reached Guanay where our next boat with a really nice crew was already waiting for us. We could just put our stuff from one boat to the other and set off after a short lunch break in Guanay.

The mines luckily got fewer and smaller.

In the evening, we set camp under the jungle trees in the evening and went for another swim.

A cricket had placed itself on Marius’ saddlebag in the meantime and we could observe it peeling itself out of his skin. It was fascinating to see it unfold its legs and wings and in the end, hard to believe that it had fit into its tiny former shape.

The next morning, we went for a walk, explored the fascinating jungle plants and took a refreshing waterfall shower.

We continued the boat ride with a few stops along the way and set camp at the river beach.

In the evening, we had a long talk with one of the tour guides who told us about the increase of gold mining by the Chinese during the last years at river Beni and the decrease of tourism which sounds like a rather sad development.

On Sunday, we had self-caught fish for breakfast and went on towards Rurrenabaque.

We stopped at a ranger station and could play around with some crazy “Tejons” and other animals.

Then, Peter from our crew showed us around in the jungle for a bit before we went on.

We reached Rurrenabaque in the afternoon and took a goodbye picture with our amazing crew. It was an amazing tour and we can highly recommend doing it with these lovely locals! (The phone number of Luis Aparicio, the boat guide is: +59167343877)

Then, we went to a cozy hostel where we relaxed for the rest of the day.
