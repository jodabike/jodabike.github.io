September 23 - September 26

Our little boat jungle trip had been great, but we had not seen many animals except for insects, birds and some river pigs. Hence, we decided to cycle to Santa Rosa to do a Pampas tour and observe more animals.

When we left Rurrenabaque, we encountered terrible road conditions. It was flat, but very sandy and an endless line of trucks passed us and covered us in dust.

Hence, we hitchhiked to the next little town and up from there the traffic luckily ceased.

We had another 75 km ahead of us and knew that we would arrive late. It would be pretty annoying to look for a hostel in the dark, we thought. But suddenly, a car that passed us and a friendly woman got off. Magali said that she was a friend of Luis, our boat guide, and had heard that we wanted to do a tour in Santa Rosa. She offered us to stay at her place and do the tour with her husband. We could hardly believe our luck and happily cycled on through the heat.

We saw many animals along our way until we arrived in Santa Rosa in the evening.

Magali welcomed us warmly, we got a room and could use the kitchen of her lovely little house.

The next morning, we set off with her husband, also called Luis, for the Pampas boat tour. They offered us a very good price for it and even got us a discount for the national park entrance.

We spent the whole day and the boat and saw countless jungle animals. The river was full of caimans, turtles and river pigs and colorful birds surrounded us.

At some parts, the river was a bit deeper and pink river dolphins live in these pools during the dry season. (In the wet season, the whole river is deep enough so that they move around it’s whole length.) In these deeper pools, there are no caimans, so we could go swimming with the dolphins.

Then, we saw some little monkeys in a tree and landed with the boat. Luis had brought some bananas to feed the monkeys and as they knew that tourists feed them, the monkeys quickly entered the boat and got crazy.

It was an amazing day and in case, you ever want to do a Pampas tour in Santa Rosa, we can highly recommend doing it with Magali and Luis! Magali‘s phone number is: +59167318311.

After another night at Magali‘s house, we got up early at 4:30 a.m. because we wanted to tackle 100 km to reach San Borja that day. In the early morning hours, it is also not that hot yet.

We soon reached a little river where we had expected a bridge to cross. Instead there was only a raft which was locked and nobody was there yet. It was not far to the other side but there were caimans in the river... After a little thinking, we took off our pants, punched around in the water with a stick to chase away the caimans and carried the bikes over the river.

After this first obstacle was taken, there were more to come. The road was actually quite nice, there was no traffic, we saw many animals again and some broken bridges could be easily bypassed.

But Hannah was feeling really sick and she got weaker and weaker. Then, Jo’s saddle screw broke and we had no adequate spare. We first thought, we were screwed, but David and Marius could provisionally fix the saddle.

The fix did not last very long though.

Luckily, a taxi unexpectedly appeared and stopped as we desperately waved at it. It was pretty full, but the people in there were very nice and squeezed poor Hannah in as well as my bike on the roof.

Jo, Marius and David cycled on through the burning sun. When we took a break in a little town, it suddenly started to rain.

First, we were pretty happy about the refreshing wet and cycled on. But soon, the rain got stronger and the road got muddy and extremely slippery.

For a moment, we thought, we could not make it to San Borja under these conditions and called Hannah to send us a taxi. After a while, the weather got better again and we could cycle on. We were still happy when the taxi arrived to spare us a muddy ride through the darkness... only David was still ambitious to cycle all the way to San Borja and even arrived a little sooner than Jo and Marius with the taxi. ;)

The next day, we all went to the bus station and booked an overnight bus to La Paz. The bus left in the afternoon and after they had shown “Rocky 1 and 2” with full volume, we could sleep in the cozy broad seats.
