*September 30 - October 5*

We left La Paz early in the morning and took a cable car out of the city center, up to the Altiplano. As the city is huge, we still had to pedal through the chaotic traffic of El Alto for a while until we finally left town behind us.

An asphalted road lead us through the flat landscape and made it easy to cycle over 100 km that day.

Tuesday, we further followed an asphalted road the whole day. It was easy in the morning, but a heavy headwind slowed us down in the afternoon.

The next day, we finally left the asphalt after a while and turned to a sandy side road to surround volcano Sajama through a national park.

But, somehow the turn, we wanted to take, did not exist and we had to turn around.... after David interpreted turning around his own way. ;)

The next possibility to turn right was more successful and we even met a tourist jeep with a guide who highly recommended us that road.

And he was right, the landscape here with view on the volcano was beautiful!

Thursday morning, we cycled on and could see two more gorgeous volcanos.

We went to a hidden hot pool and took a bath whilst enjoying the amazing volcano views.

As we went on, the road conditions got more challenging, because it was sandy and bumpy, but still rideable.

When we left the national park, the guard wanted to have 100 Bol entrance fee per person but we managed to negotiate him down to 50 Bol for both of us.

The last few kilometers for that day were asphalted again but thanks to a really heavy headwind it took us hours and a lot of nerve to reach Tambo Quemado where we slept in hostel to get wind shelter for the night.

From Tambo Quemado, a dog followed us for a while the next day.

But luckily, he was a little smarter than our last dog and gave up after about 20 km.

We followed a road that many people had warned us about because the road conditions were supposed to be terrible. And indeed, the road was either a bumpy washboard or deep sand, so it was an exhausting ride. Nevertheless, it was not as bad as we had expected it to be and rideable for the most parts. The wide and flat landscape was also fascinating and we only crossed some tiny rural towns.

A river crossing was a nice refreshment.

In the afternoon, a heavy wind came up again and we decided to reach the next little town, Julo, to seek wind shelter for the night.

When we arrived in town, we asked a friendly woman for a wind shelter and she did not only offer us a room to pitch our tent but also dinner and breakfast. We were invited to the great village fiesta that was obviously taking place this weekend. We met many friendly locals and had a tasty dinner and breakfast at the big feast table.

Saturday, we continued our bumpy, sandy ride and stopped at a little lonely town around noon. The ways ahead of us were parting and we asked a friendly woman for the better route. Her name was Nora and after she informed us about the road conditions, she invited us for lunch in her little house.

The hospitality and kindness of the people along this road was just incredible. Generally, all the friendly and open-minded people we meet during our trip are among the things that we appreciate and admire most!

Strengthened by the tasty lunch, we continued our way.

A strong wind came up in the afternoon again and we sought shelter in a house in construction in a vacated village. We also had to fix a whole in Davidâ€™s tire here.

The next morning, we only had to cycle another short bumpy passage until we hit asphalt again. We reached Sabaya for a lunch break and resupply.

Then, we left the asphalt again and approached the salt deserts Coipasa and Uyuni over the flat Altiplano. The soil slowly turned from sand into more and more salt.

The last kilometers before the town Coipasa, the salt was soaking wet and it was challenging to ride (or push) through it. But we finally reached town in the evening and had dinner at an amazingly friendly woman, Petronila. She also told us, that this day around noon two German cyclists had passed her restaurant as well... could that have been Hannah and Marius?
