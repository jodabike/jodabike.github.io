*October 6 - October 11*

As we had such a good time eating dinner at Petronilaâ€™s, we went there again for breakfast on Sunday morning. And it was amazingly tasty again: she made fresh pan bread with scrambled eggs and a Bolivian thick sweet maize drink for us.

Well strengthened, we started our way trough the Coipasa salt desert.

We tried to do some perspective photos with self-timer but were rather unsuccessful.

After a while of cycling, we noticed two shapes following us and soon recognized two cyclists.... Hannah and Marius! :)

It was really nice to meet to those two again and after a week of cycling different routes, we had many stories to tell each other. The team was reunited! And we could take perspective photos now!

And more photos in that fascinating environment!

The tracks on the salt were really flat and well rideable for a while. But at the edge of the salt desert, the salt was mixed with dirt and we sank in with our bikes. Hence, the last few kilometers of that day were mostly pushing and really exhausting.

On Tuesday morning, we cycled to Llica to fill up all the water bottles we had and buy supplies for the bigger Uyuni salt desert.

At the beginning of this desert, the tracks were smooth and we already thought, we would get through here fast. But soon, the salt soil got harder and had built bumpy crusts, so we had to slow our tempo again.

However, it was absolutely fascinating to ride through that white void!

We camped in the middle of nowhere, being really lucky that there was no wind that night.

It was even warm enough that night for David to climb out of the tent and take some amazing pictures of the starry sky!

The next day, we rode on through the desert and stopped at a little island for lunch.

We also passed Incahuasi island where hundreds of tourist jeeps land and tourists have to pay 30 Bol to watch the desert from the top of the island.

We rode on for a bit and camped in the desert again.

On Wednesday, we further followed the desert tracks, still sometimes sweet and smooth, sometimes bitter and bumpy.

We met another German cyclist in the desert, Michael, and rode together for a while.

In the evening, we set camp shortly before the small village San Juan and entered town the next morning.

In San Juan, we checked in into a nice hostel where we could clean our bikes and clothes.

David and Jo also did some supply shopping for the upcoming Lagunas route where we would not be able to buy food for the next eight to ten days.
