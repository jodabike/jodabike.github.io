*October 12 - October 19*

We left San Juan together with Hannah and Marius but soon had to say goodbye again because they wanted to ride to Chile and not take the Lagunas route. But we had had a great time together again! :)

<!--more-->

So, David and Jo headed towards the Lagunas route. It is a famous route among cyclists here because it is supposed to be really beautiful but also very tough. We can confirm both! The route leads through the high Andes along beautiful lakes but there are no towns for about 300 km and the road conditions are quite bad. But, many tourist jeep groups take this route as well, so we were never totally off civilization.

The first day, we had to push our bikes a lot because the road was really sandy.

The second day, the road got better for a while and up from then, it was mostly rideable but still very exhausting. It was a bumpy washboard and often very sandy as well.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2013.10.19%2C%2009%2013%2019M.jpg" /></p>

Two rare sights: a steaming mountain and David pushing his bike:
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2013.10.19%2C%2010%2033%2024M.jpg" /></p>

Ok, he only pushed his bike here because one of covers of his shift cable broke... and we luckily had a spare one.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2013.10.19%2C%2010%2042%2033M.jpg" /></p>

And then, we also had a flat tire.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2013.10.19%2C%2012%2016%2023M.jpg" /></p>

When we reached the first lake, Laguna Cañapa, our efforts and pain were rewarded with amazing views!

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2013.10.19%2C%2014%2032%2034M.jpg" /></p>

It is absolutely fascinating how these delicate, elegant, pink creatures live in such a rough environment where the sun burns relentlessly during the day, the wind blows heavily and it gets ice cold during the nights.

We cycled on and soon reached the next lake, Laguna Hedionda, also full of flamingos.

There was a hostel next to the lake where we wanted to refill our water bottles. But, they only filled up two liters because they did not have much drinking water themselves (the tap water here is salty). As we don’t like the concept of buying bottled water, which they offered us, we stood in front of the hostel and discussed our options. Finally, we bought another 2 liters of Coca Cola and they gave us a whole bag of leftover bread and pancakes. And as if that was not enough good luck, we also got a 5 liter water canister from a jeep tourist who had seen us discussing. :)

It had gotten really windy during our water hunt, so we decided to camp behind the hotel.

The next day, we continued our bumpy, sandy ride and passed another lake as well as beautiful mountains and rocks.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2014.10.19%2C%2016%2057%2059M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2012%2016%2013M.jpg" /></p>

We found a good wind shelter for the night, which was absolutely necessary up there because the wind gets incredibly strong in the afternoons.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2007%2025%2031M.jpg" /></p>

It was really cold that night up there at 4600 m. Our water bottles were frozen rock solid the next morning.

We continued our way and passed “el arbol de piedra”, the stone tree, and met a cute desert fox.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2011%2018%2040M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2011%2029%2028M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2011%2033%2015M.jpg" /></p>

The fox was not afraid of us at all which was a little weird. He was probably used to tourists feeding him but we were not sure and rather kept our distance.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2011%2036%2033M.jpg" /></p>

We also saw some vicuñas up there “grazing”... we wonder how they find something to eat in this desert.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2011%2053%2050M.jpg" /></p>

In the afternoon, the road conditions got so bad and the wind so strong that we had to push our bikes even though the road led downhill.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2014%2018%2026M.jpg" /></p>

It was quite frustrating but again, we were rewarded with an amazing view on Laguna Colorada, a red lake.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2014%2020%2016M.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2015%2057%2031M.jpg" /></p>

We took a little break at the national park entrance, filled up our water and had fun with some cute company.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2015%2022%2033M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2015%2023%2006M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2015%2027%2017M.jpg" /></p>

We actually wanted to cycle another 10 km up from there to reach a hostel for the night. But Jo was pretty exhausted and so we just pitched our tent next to the road with great lake view.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2016%2051%2020M.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2015.10.19%2C%2016%2038%2044M.jpg" /></p>

However, the bad thing about that spot was that it had no wind cover and the wind increased extremely when we lay in the tent. It actually got so strong that we decided to pack our stuff and walk to the hostel in the dark because we did not want to risk the tent to break.

But of course, shortly after we had started our night walk, the wind just stopped as if the weather wanted to mock us. Hence, we pitched our tent again and had a calm, cold night, a few kilometers further down the road.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2016.10.19%2C%2007%2012%2036M.jpg" /></p>

Our way lead us through desert mountain landscapes the next day and we started to ascent our highest pass.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2016.10.19%2C%2012%2043%2052M.jpg" /></p>

To escape the wind, we set camp in the early afternoon when we found a nice wind shelter.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2016.10.19%2C%2015%2005%2023M.jpg" /></p>

After a very cold night, we ascended the last view kilometers to the pass and made a little detour to finally crack the 5000 m of altitude with our bikes!

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2017.10.19%2C%2009%2000%2051M.jpg" /></p>

The landscape up there looked a bit like Mars.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2017.10.19%2C%2009%2013%2059M.jpg" /></p>

Next, we reached geysers, which looked awesome and smelled pretty bad.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2017.10.19%2C%2009%2040%2028M.jpg" /></p>

Then, we cycled to Lake Chalviri.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2017.10.19%2C%2012%2004%2029M.jpg" /></p>

There was a free hot spring with flamingo view. We enjoyed the hot bath after freezing a lot during the past days.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2017.10.19%2C%2012%2057%2036M.jpg" /></p>

As there were several hostels at that lake, we decided to take a room for that night. We watched the starry sky from a second hot pool that evening.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2018.10.19%2C%2007%2034%2057M.jpg" /></p>

A tourist group also stayed at that hostel and we could eat from their dinner and breakfast for free. In addition, we could take all their breakfast leftovers with us, which included a pile of pancakes! :)

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2018.10.19%2C%2007%2005%2043M.jpg" /></p>

Shortly after the lake, we passed the Dalí desert which acutally looks like it originates in one of Dalí's paintings.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-10-21-san-juan-to-san-pedro-de-atacama/Foto%2018.10.19%2C%2008%2014%2039M.jpg" /></p>

This day, the wind already started in the morning hours and we were happy to pass another hot pool to warm up a bit after riding along beautiful mountains again.

We passed the two last lakes of the route, Laguna Blanca and Laguna Verde, which looked fantastic as well!

Then, we approached the border to Chile and met the friendly border official on our way. He took out the exit stamp out of his pocket and stamped our passport on our bike saddles.

Chile!

And suddenly, the road was covered with that smooth grey substance on which you can roll without being shaken or stuck all the time!

We rode another 5 km to the Chilean entrance border control where we welcomed rather unfriendly.

They wanted to search our bags for fruits, which are illegal to bring over the border. But when the guard saw Jo’s bike stand stick, he took that away from us, because wood is also forbidden and luckily he refrained from controlling the bags (in which we carried quite some “illegal” goods).

And we were also lucky that bamboo somehow does not count as wood and David could keep his beloved stick that he actually carries with him since Ecuador.

In the beautiful evening light, we cycled towards San Pedro de Atacama.

We set camp next to the road and discovered that we were not alone.

Stunning sunset over the Atacama desert!

The next morning, we rolled down the last view kilometers to San Pedro.

We arrived early and could use the rest of the day to relax after having accomplished the Lagunas route.
