October 23 - October 26

Chile has been in turmoil. Due to planned elevations of metro and electricity prices, the Chileans have risen up against the government with protests, strikes and partly also violence.

These circumstances impeded our plan to go by bus from San Pedro to Puerto Montt. We actually managed to catch the only bus departing from San Pedro to Calama but then, it looked like we were stuck. Most of the many bus companies in Calama were on strike and closed. The only two open ones did not want to take our bicycles with them because of the overload of these few busses.

A loud demonstration passed us while we were thinking and finally deciding to go to the airport. Flying seemed to be the only save option to reach Puerto Montt now, even though we are anything but friends of taking planes.

At the airport, we found out that it was not possible to buy flight tickets at a desk there, but we saw an affordable flight online, leaving that same evening. This, we needed to pack our bikes and luckily met a really friendly guy at the airport cargo station who helped us improvising a bike package.

Once, the bikes were packed, we wanted to book the flight online but now it was outsold and so we had to spend a night and a day at the airport to wait on the next affordable plane.

Getting on this plane was quite a hassle because we found out our flight was cancelled. We were changed to an earlier flight which we missed because we had to cut open the packaging of one of the bikes to prove it was no bomb and then we were rebooked again. We also had to pay an insolent extra fee for the bikes.

But somehow, we reached Santiago where we had to spend another night at the airport and had some troubles checking in the bikes again.

Finally, we reached Puerto Montt in the morning, tired and quite stressed out.

We experienced a bit of a cultural shock when we entered the city. The landscape was suddenly green and wet and the living standards so much more European than in all other parts of South America we had seen before. And we had missed the smooth transition of landscape and cultures that we had experienced so far by cycling though the countries.

We spent the day in town, shopped supplies, walked around and sat in a cafe for a while. Many shops, restaurants and banks were barricaded or about to shut their windows with plywood boards and more and more people were gathering in the city center.

In the late afternoon, a huge demonstration of thousands of people went through the city to show disagreement with the government.

In the evening, we went to Sebastian's who we had contacted via warmshowers.org. He and his girlfriend Valentina welcomed us warmly at their lovely little wood house right at the beach and we could finally relax a bit.

We spent another cozy day at their place and were pleased by good talks, sunny weather and great food.
