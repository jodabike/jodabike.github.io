September 27 - September 29

We arrived in La Paz early in the morning with the bus. It is a huge city in the midst of the Andes and spans over more than 1000 m of altitude difference. Apart from busses, the public transport in the city is done by cable cars which is pretty amazing!

We hopped in one of the cable cars with our bikes to spare us the cycling through the city chaos.

Out goal was Cristian‘s „Casa de Ciclistas“ in the city center, a home and meeting point for cyclists who travel through Bolivia. We arrived at 7 a.m., were let in by one of the other cyclists who was already up and had a cozy breakfast in the living room. By and by, the other cyclists got up and we got to know about 10 interesting, nice people who are cycling through South America as well. We exchanged stories and experiences and discussed our routes.

For the rest of the day, we went through the city and relaxed in the casa.

Saturday, we spent the whole afternoon flying over the city in cable cars. It was an amazing experience to see the city from a birds-eye perspective!

Hannah and Marius left La Paz on Sunday morning and it felt strange to go separate ways again after three weeks of cycling together. But it was also for the best, because they wanted to take it a little slower after some rough riding while David and Jo had further dirt road plans. ;)

David and Jo also wanted to spend one more day in La Paz to organize some stuff and further enjoy the colorful city, so we spent another relaxing day in town.
