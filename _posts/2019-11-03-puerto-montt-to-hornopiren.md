*October 27 - November 3*

After Patagonia hat welcomed us with some beautiful sunshine on our first day, the spring weather showed its true face Sunday morning: rain was pouring down. Sebastian, our host, said that this was just some water coming down and we should better get used to it. So, we reluctantly packed our stuff and hit the road towards Cochamó.

Luckily, the rain stopped in the afternoon, but heavy clouds still blocked the view on the two volcanoes we passed.

We found a perfect shelter to camp in the empty rooms next to the football field of an abandoned school which kept us dry during the night when the rain started again.

Monday was quite wet as well and we cycled along green forests and blue lakes and rivers.

The landscape here is totally different than all other landscapes we had passed so far: water is so abundant here that the vegetation is deep green and dense, everything is wet or at least moist and many lakes and fjords complete the beautiful picture of that vital land.

In the afternoon, the rain got heavier and heavier, our clothes were soaking wet and we took a break in a cozy restaurant in Cochamó to warm up for a while.

As we did not find an appropriate hostel or shelter for the night, we improvised a little roof with the tarp we still had from the flight and camped in the rain that night.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2029.10.19%2C%2012%2002%2056M.jpg" /></p>

Rain was still pouring down the next morning but that forecast had promised sunshine for the following day. Hence, we started our way up into the Cochamó valley which is supposed to be really beautiful.

We soon noticed that the hiking path up there was not suitable for bikes, so we left our bikes behind (hidden in some bushes) and hiked on.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2029.10.19%2C%2013%2054%2052M.jpg" /></p>

It was a beautiful, adventurous trail but also so wet, that it was often hard to tell if it was still a trail or already a creek.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2029.10.19%2C%2015%2041%2000M.jpg" /></p>

When we arrived at the upper end of the valley, we were soaking wet and pretty cold again. Thus, we were incredibly happy when we reached the campground "La Junta" where we could pitch our tent in a hut and dry our clothes at a fire place. And the best thing was, the fire was already burning when we came because a girl from Canada, Camille, had arrived shortly before us and was warming up herself at the fire as well.

Wednesday morning, we could hardly believe it, the sun was actually shining and we enjoyed it so much! It was the start of a spotless day, perfect for hiking and we could finally see the gorgeous Yosemite-like peaks, surrounding the green valley.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2031.10.19%2C%2010%2046%2025M.jpg" /></p>

We started our hike together with Camille up to the "Anfiteatro" and first had to cross river Cochamó to get to the other side of the valley.

A steep hiking trail lead us uphill through the dense, lively forest.

We made a little detour to a fascinating waterfall.

At the top of the trail, we were stunned by breathtaking views on the immense snowy granite walls around us and enjoyed for quite a while. (Unfortunately, our camera had gotten a little wet during all the rain and would not want to turn on anymore, so we could only shoot phone pictures that day.)

On the way down, we paused in the green valley again and soaked up all the sunshine we could get.

And we also visited another gorgeous waterfall close to the campground.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2030.10.19%2C%2019%2010%2006M.jpg" /></p>

When we came back to camp, around 15 more tourists had arrived and set up their tents. Some of them had booked horses to carry up their luggage.

We had a gregarious evening at the campfire and woke up to sunshine again the next day.

We hiked back down to our bikes and the path was much dryer this time.... until it started to rain again in the afternoon.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2031.10.19%2C%2014%2003%2056M.jpg" /></p>

Also, we got the impression that season would start here on November 1st because at least 60 tourists passed us on their way up to the valley in the rain. The campground, that we have had to ourselves one night before, would be quite crowded this night.

When we reached the bikes, we were pretty wet again and only rode a short distance until we reached a little cabin with some people working inside. We asked if we could stay the night and the boss, José, offered us to sleep on the cabin by the oven (for a lot of money!). As we had no food left, we also bought some overpriced pasta and a little bread from him and warmed ourselves at the fireplace.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2001.11.19%2C%2016%2009%2038M.jpg" /></p>

That evening, Jo heard a funny noise coming from her air mattress when she tried to lay down and unfortunately, it actually broke in a weird way so that it is not really usable anymore.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2001.11.19%2C%2007%2008%2057M.jpg" /></p>

But, she was so lucky that there was actually a mattress standing in the corner of the cabin that she could sleep on.

When we got up the next morning, the weather was miserable. It seemed like the rain had gotten stronger even though this had hardly been possible.

José and his two workers came to the cabin in the morning and he offered us to help them working during the day to spend another free night in the cabin in exchange. We agreed and helped to clean and sand the wood walls of the toilets of a campground that he was preparing to open for the upcoming summer season.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2001.11.19%2C%2010%2004%2024M.jpg" /></p>

At noon, we had lunch together in the cabin and afterwards, we had to collect rubbish (still in the pouring rain) that lay around at the camping area.

When we were done, the guys headed back to Cochamó town and offered us to take us so that we could buy supplies as we were completely out of food. But they only offered to take us there and we would have had to hitchhike back or taken an expensive taxi, so we rather stayed in the cabin. José would not even leave us the banana and two carrots that he still had because our deal was a free night, not free food.

So, somehow, it had been nice that we could stay dry in this cabin but we also felt quite exploited because we had payed a way too high price for the first night, worked a day and did not have any food for our second night. José also manages one of the campgrounds further up in the Cochamó valley (Trawen Camping) of which we had read many bad reviews, mostly saying that he would be only out for money, and could absolutely see this side of him now.

Well, the very nice neighbor luckily sold us some pasta and bread (for a way more appropriate price) and so we spent another good night at the cabin.

Saturday, the sun finally showed up and we had a beautiful day of cycling through the adorable landscape.

Around noon, we stopped at a little store where could finally restock our supplies and take a lunch break. While we sat at the little bench in front of the store, we felt like we were displaced to the Wild West for a short moment: a cowboy-like looking guy came galloping to the shop on his prideful horse, tied it to the fence, lashed his whip to the ground with a loud snap to chase away the dogs, went shopping and galloped away again.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2002.11.19%2C%2011%2021%2059M.jpg" /></p>

We camped right at the beach that night.

The next day was cloudy but at least it stayed dry in the morning.

<p><img alt="Image" title="icon" src="https://jodabike.github.io/blogmedia/imgs/2019-11-03-puerto-montt-to-hornopiren/Foto%2003.11.19%2C%2008%2043%2009M.jpg" /></p>

Hence, we arrived almost dry at Hornopirén in the early afternoon when the rain started again. We could buy a (pretty shitty, yet better than nothing) new sleeping mat for Jo and would take the ferry from here the next day.
