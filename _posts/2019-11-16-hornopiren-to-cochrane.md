November 4 - November 16

From Hornopirén, we took a ferry to Caleta Gonzalo, as there is no road along this fjord. Five other cyclists also took that ferry, the carratera austral really seems to be full of cyclists, even in the current pre-season.

The guards on the ferry searched for a place to put all the bikes and finally we could all load them in the back of an empty truck. Then, we could spend some relaxed hours on the boat while the weather constantly changed between sunshine and rain.

When we arrived, the weather had decided for rain again and we thankfully accepted the offer of the nice truck drivers to take us with them to Chaitén. Together with two of the other cyclists, we had a bumpy ride in the dark loading space of the truck, sitting on euro pallets.

We shortly paused at a nice view point and reached Chaitén in the early evening.

As it rained again the next morning, we got up early to get another ride to Villa Santa Lucia with the nice truck drivers. Again, it was a dark and cold ride but a good opportunity to cover some distance without cycling through the heavy rain.

In Villa Santa Lucia, we invited our drivers for breakfast in a lovely little cafe. Here, we could also warm up at the oven and get some tasty cake for Jo's birthday breakfast. :)

Together with Petre, who we had met on the ferry, we rode to La Junta afterwards. It was an easy ride on asphalt road and the sun even showed up from time to time!

In La Junta, we spent a relaxed evening and enjoyed the rest of Jo's birthday.

Heavy rain on Wednesday morning made us stay in the hostel another day. We spent most of the day inside until it finally stopped to pour down in the afternoon. Then, we used the good weather for a nice little hike through a dense forest with lots of dense bamboo trees.

We camped at a beautiful lake and spent the evening with a lovely French couple. They are on their way to Alaska with their camper van and their funny little cat. (@adventureandpermaculture)

Saturday and Sunday were two more great cycling days. The Carratera Austral is asphalted way more than we had expected and also the non-asphalted parts are well ridaleable. Hence, we could easily cover quite some distance during these sunny days. The landscape fascinated us a lot because the colors are so intense and the snowy mountains so great. The only sad thing is that there are fences everywhere. Every little meter next to the road is shut off with barbed wire and we are not sure if it is made to keep cows inside or tourists outside.

We passed Coyhaique Sunday afternoon and found a new inflatable sleeping mattress for Jo! However, withdrawing money at the bank was not that easy because most banks were barricaded due to the ongoing manifestations in bigger cities.

Monday, the weather was even better than the days before and we crossed a beautiful pass in the hot sunshine.

The only suitable campsite we found, was a tiny spot between thorny bushes and another fence.

Nice weather and scenic landscapes also delighted us on Tuesday and Wednesday.

We made a "Nalca" salad for dinner. It is a plant that grows everywhere along the road here and some locals showed us how to prepare them:

After some cycling on Thursday, we made another little hike to Lago Leones. It is one of the few free hikes around here because most of the other ones are quite expensive and touristic.
We could actually ride our bikes for the first few kilometers of the trail but then had to leave them behind before crossing a small bridge.

It was a beautiful hike along a weather border between rain and sunshine.

Friday afternoon, the sun came out again and we enjoyed a nice ride to Cochrane. Luckily, the days get longer and longer and we reached town at 9:30pm with the last sunlight.
