November 17 - November 21

It rained again on Sunday morning and we were tempted to stay another night at Piero's. But as the sun finally showed up in the afternoon, we packed our stuff and hit the road again. Piero also went for a little ride, so we all left the house together in the sun... which did not last very long, but at least it did not rain.

Monday, we cycled only a short distance because heavy rain started to pour down and we got really cold. Hence, we sought shelter under the canopy of an empty community house...

... and finally went inside to camp in the dry.

Heavy rain also accompanied us through the next day, so we first tried to hitchhike a bit - without success. (Mainly because there is hardly any traffic on this remote last part of the Carratera.)

By the end of the day, we used a short rain break to cycle at least a few kilometers and camp in another shelter.

More rain on Wednesday did not make it easy for us to leave our shelter but we had to cycle another 20km to port Yungay to catch a ferry. Hence, we got really wet when we started to ride up a little pass to get there, but when we reached the top, we were rewarded with some sunshine and beautiful views.

At the port, we funnily met our friend Petre again as well as Paul, another cyclist we had already met in Hornopir√©n.

Together, we enjoyed the short boat ride in the warm and dry cabin while rain was pouring down outside again.

At the other side of the lake, the other two cyclists took a bus to O'Higgins, while we cycled on through the undecided weather. It got actually quite good (at that time, slight drizzling rain that sometimes even stopped for a while definitely counted as good weather after so many days of heavy rain).

When we reached another cozy cyclist shelter in the early afternoon, heavy rain started again and we were really happy about our good timing that day.

For our last 50km to O'Higgins, we were lucky with the weather again. The sun came out enough to dry our shoes and feet for the first time in many days!

When we arrived in O'Higgins, we checked in a cozy warm hostel and tried to buy ferry tickets for the next day. The border crossing from O'Higgins to Argentina is only doable by foot or bike because there is nothing but a small road and a hiking trail between two lakes that need to be passed by boats. We were first told that the ferries were all fully booked for the next few days but after some discussions, managed to get tickets for the next day. We were really relieved because the weather was finally supposed to get good again and we were looking forward to some hiking in the sun!
