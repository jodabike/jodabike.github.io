*November 22 - November 23*

We got up early to fetch our boat over Lago O'Higgins. It was a 7km ride from town to the port and we made a short stop a a little viewpoint on the way to take a quick photo with the camera.

At the port, four other cyclists (which we knew quite well by now because we had met them a few times along the road) and several hikers waited to mount the little boat. We had to remove all our panniers because the bikes were loaded on the roof of the boat. Then, the crew started to throw the panniers on the boat with a hectic attitude and in that rush, a guy grabbed Jo's little front bag at its lid and wanted to pass it to the boat. But the lid opened and we just saw things dropping into the the (9 meter deep and ice cold) water. Our GPS tracker was lost right away. Luckily, we had taken the camera out of that bag at the viewpoint shortly before and only it's neoprene bag swam on the water.

Well, we still had a nice boat trip and enjoyed sunshine and nice views after the excitement in the morning.

Next, we had to cover 20km between Lago O'Higgins and Lago Desierto and cross the border to Argentina.

Checking out of Chile at the most beautiful and also slowest border checkpoint.

The first 15km were still on Chilean ground and there was a nice gravel road leading through the amazing landscape.

We took a long break at the border and enjoyed first views at mount Fitz Roy with Petre and Paul, two of the other cyclists.

And we had absolutely underestimated the last five kilometers to the next lake where we wanted to catch the next boat at the same afternoon. The road turned into a muddy trail with many fallen logs over which we had to carry our bikes and many river crossings.
We were running out of time and had to rush to fetch the boat. 5km of downhill trail took us about three hours!

In one of the river crossings, David slipped and fell while he carried his bike. And the camera finally dipped into the water as well after we had saved it in the morning.

We reached the port in time and got our passports stamped at the Argentinian border control, which also had quite a nice view. We dried the camera in the sun for a while and made it actually work again after a while! :) Only the lens still had water inside but we could use our pancake lens for now and David managed to clean and dry the original lens the next day. What a relief! Because the gorgeous mountain peaks around here are really worth some good photos!

Together with the other cyclists, who also had struggled with the last part of the trail, we enjoyed our boat ride over Lago Desierto. This time, the crew was amazingly friendly and even gave us free hot chocolate!

When we reached the port, we rode on towards El Chaltén for a bit. Our feet had just begun to dry again but that did not last long.

We camped close to the trailhead of a hike to Lago de los Tres that we planned for the next day.

Saturday morning, we hid our bikes in the bushes and went for a beautiful hike. The path first lead through a wild forest with amazing views on Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre.

The last part of the trail was a steep ascent up to Lago de los Tres and then, the most stunning panorama opened up in front of us!

We enjoyed the beautiful view for a long while (and took about 500 photos of it) before we descended.

We cycled the last 15km to El Chaltén in the evening light.

El Chaltén is a touristic little town in the midst of amazing mountain peaks and glaciers. Therefore, we decided to do a longer hike here the next days to explore that fascinating terrain.

Sunday, we spent most of the day walking around along the hills close to town and enjoyed sunshine and views. In the evening, we started to organize our hike and rented some equipment for it.
