November 30 - December 2

After a day of relaxing in the nice hostel 'Casa Azul', where we met many other cyclists with fascinating stories and tours, we hit the road again on Saturday.

It was a serious safety risk to cycle towards the pampas with the amazing mountain panorama in our backs because we had to turn around all the time to get some last views. ;)

With some good tailwind, we could easily cover 110 km and camped in an abandoned pink house where many other cyclists had sought shelter before us. One of the cyclists we had met in El Chaltén, Matt from England, camped there with us and we had a gregarious evening.

Rather unexciting Pampa landscapes dominated the following day on our way to El Calafate.

In the afternoon, Jo's rear hub gave up its service (our third broken Shimano HB-M525 VIAM hub on this tour!) and we couldn't ride on. Hence, we hitchhiked the last 30 km to El Calafate on the back of a pickup of a friendly Argentinian family.

We set camp at a nice campground in town and brought Jo's bike to a mechanic. He said, he would need half a day to fix it and se we decided to visit the glacier Moreno the next day.

The glacier is another 50 km west of town, so we hitchhiked to the national park. It is a very touristic and expensive park but the view on the glacier was spectacular!

In the evening, we could pick up Jo's fixed bike at the unfriendly mechanic. But, with a new hub, the bike was at least ready to roll again.
