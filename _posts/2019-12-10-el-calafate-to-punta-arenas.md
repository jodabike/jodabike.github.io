*December 3 - December 8*

After another night at the campground, we left El Calafate the next day and cycled on through the pampas. The last 40km were quite tough because we had to ride against the wind, but we reached an abandoned police station where we could camp sheltered from the wind.

We had thought that the wind in the previous afternoon was strong, but on Wednesday, we learnt what strong wind means in Patagonia. Wind gusts of up to 90km/h blew us from our bikes and we had to push our bikes at many parts. After a distance only 40km, we called it a day and slept at a lovely police/ street worker station where we were welcomed warmly.

The wind was still incredibly strong the next morning, so we decided to hitchhike a bit. We easily found a ride which got us close to the Chilean border which we crossed by bike.

After passing the border controls, we got into another car to reach the national park Torres del Paine in the afternoon.

We entered the park and camped next to a lovely German couple with whom we spent a nice evening: Claudia and Michel had cycled Europe and the Americas for a couple of years and are now traveling in a camper van (their blog: 2like2.bike).

Together, we hiked to Lago Torres the next day. It was a nice day-hike leading to a beautiful view point.

We wanted to cycle to another campsite in the afternoon but again, terrible headwinds made us change our plans and we just camped next to the road, hoping that the wind would get less over night. And the view from this spot was also not too bad!

Well, the wind did not ease up during the night, so we fought on the next morning, until the road finally made a left turn and the wind began to push us.

We stopped for another short hike before we left the park again.

Sunday, we let the wind push us to Puerto Natales where we arrived at midday.

We jumped into a bus to Punta Arenas right away because we wanted to catch a ferry the next morning... and had to find out that this ferry to Porvenir goes every day, except for Monday! Hence, we took an involuntary break day in Punta Arenas.
