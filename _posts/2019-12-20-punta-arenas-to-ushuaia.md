*December 10 - December 18*

After our break day in Punta Arenas, we took the ferry to Porvenir on Tuesday morning. It was the beginning of our final stretch on the island "Tierra del Fuego" to reach our destination, Ushuaia.

Pampa landscape with nice views on the ocean and tailwinds were on the program for the rest of that day.

Thanks to the government of Tierra del Fuego, some cozy wind-shelter huts for cyclists stand along the road and of them provided us shelter for a quiet night.

Wednesday, we rode on through the pampas and crossed the Argentinian border again.

When we rode further south the next day, the landscape began to become more interesting again with animals, forests and mountains.

We spent the night on a lovely campground and woke up to rain on Friday.

Hence, we cycled to the famous bakery "La Union" in Tolhuin and took long break to warm up there.

But, we wanted to get a little further and cycled on through the rain. It payed off because we were invited to a hot tea by some friendly gendarmes and afterwards found an amazing house by a lake where we could spend the night.

Saturday, we had to cross one last little pass before we got to the ocean again.

Then, we took a remote, beautiful detour route along the coast to Ushuaia. Here, it really felt like we were at the end of the world, in the midst of pure, untouched, beautiful nature.

Sadly, a road is about to be built through this (actually protected) pure stretch of land...

The price for this wonderful panorama route was a short and tough hike-a-bike section on the next day. For about a kilometer, we had to take off our panniers and carry bikes and panniers separately through deep mud and steep hills.

But, it soon got better again and we actually enjoyed pushing ourselves and the bikes to the limit one last time.

We camped a few kilometers before Ushuaia, enjoying the remoteness and slowly realizing that our journey was coming to an end. A strange feeling swaying between joy and sadness, excitement and melancholy.

And then, we actually reached Ushuaia!

Tuesday, we did a beautiful hike up to "Cerro del Media" from where we could see the whole city.

Then, we had to pack the bikes into boxes and began our journey home on Wednesday to be back home in time for Christmas.
