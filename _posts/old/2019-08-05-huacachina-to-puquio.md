*August 1 - August 4*

We left the oasis on Thursday morning after a really good coffee and went to Ica to buy some supplies.

Then, we took a bus to Nazca because the Panamericana that leads there is quite busy and we just had enough of that road.

We passed the Nazca lines and could see a few from the bus. They are pretty famous lines and pictures in the desert ground which are many thousand years old. As it has not rained in the area since, they got preserved for such a long time.

(Well, it's hard to recognize any lines here, but we think we saw some. :D)

On Friday we started our long ascent back to the mountains through a dry and hot landscape. The road was mounting slightly and steadily and was comfortable to gain height. We often think, that Peruvians just really know how to build good roads! :)

The landscape slowly got greener again!

From our camp site we could see one of the highest dunes in the world. A pile of sand that reaches a height of more than 2000 m.

We had dinner in the evening light. Our usual dinner when we cook ourselves is spaghetti soup (we eat the noodles in a soup to not waste the water) with varying vegggies.

Our ascent went on on Saturday and we met a French/ Spanish couple, Raquel and Nico, cycling from Ushuaia to Colombia (2cyclos1etoile.blogg.org).

On Sunday we finally reached the top of the pass at 4200 m and could roll down for a bit after three days of constant mounting.

Jo had some problems with her front wheel which made some cracking noises.

It's nothing serious but we needed some further tools to fix it properly which we hopefully find in Puquio.

As you might have noticed on our pictures, we now have a logo which David has designed! It is our initials "Joda" as a bike. :)
