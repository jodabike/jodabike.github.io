&#9654; Where are you from?
- We live in the South of Germany.

&#9654; What is your job?
- We just finished our studies and hence had time for the trip.

&#9654; Do your legs/butts hurt?
- Our legs got quickly used to cycling everyday, however hiking detours sometimes lead to sore muscles. We had well suiting saddles that were adjusted properly which is really important. Although this minimizes any butt pain, washboard roads could still be quite painful.

&#9654; Don't you have fear?
- In the beginning, we were a bit worried about getting robbed or so. But soon, we noticed how incredibly friendly people are and chances that something bad happens seemed really low.

&#9654; How did you learn Spanish?
- We had some tiny pre-knowledge and knew French already. The rest came just by having conversations. However, in spite of being able to talk fluently, our grammar really sucks (but no one cares..).

&#9654; Do you have instagram/whatsapp/facebook?
- No, only this blog due to privacy concerns related with facebook products.

&#9654; Are you insane?
- We guess you have to be a little bit out of your mind to ride your bike for over half a year, so maybe a little bit...

&#9654; Did you do other tours before?
- We crossed the Alps several times and did some other smaller tours in Europe.

&#9654; When did you take your last shower?
- Probably, around a week ago :D.

&#9654; From where to where are you riding?
- We went form Quito (Ecuador) to Ushuaia (Argentina).

&#9654; How many kilometers/hours do you ride per day?
- These numbers depend a lot on slope and road quality: In average we rode around 50km a day in 6-12h.

&#9654; Where do you sleep?
- Most of the times we just wild camped in our tent. Sometimes in bigger towns we stayed at hostels, also to shower once in a while :D.

&#9654; How long/far have you been on the road?
- Alltogether, we rode around 10.000 km in pretty much exactly 7 months.

&#9654; What was the most beautiful part of your journey? / What was your favorite part?
- This is incredible hard to answer. We had so many great experiences with amazing people and stunning landscapes. For example, David was really impressed by the Fitz Roy range in Patagonia, but peoplewise this part is very touristic and maybe not that interesting. On the other hand, the Bolivian Altiplano is landscapewise not that exciting, however its people were just unbelievably warm-hearted.

&#9654; Did you have some bad/negative experience?
- The unfriendliest encounter on our whole journey was literally on its very last day when we returned by plane: While napping at Barcelona airport a cleaning man got really mad at us for no reason and yelled at us that he had just called airport security (which never came) to get rid of us. That was just weird.

&#9654; How did you bring your bikes to South America?
- We took them with us on the plane. It cost around 100 &euro; for each bike, each way.

&#9654; How did you get to South America?
- Although, it is not the best option for the environment, we chose to fly. One of the main reasons for this decision were that it just saves a lot of time. However, on the next trip we'd like to avoid taking planes.

&#9654; How did you get the idea?
- We both like to go outside and to explore the world. In our opinion, the bicycle is the perfect mean of transportation: You are close to the nature and still fast enough to actually cover some distance.

&#9654; Why did you choose South America?
- South America offers with its Andes a perfect opportunity to follow a mountain range from its beginning to its end.

&#9654; Why do you carry sticks?
- Our (mostly) bamboo sticks are multipurpose tools: We use them as bike stands, car spacer, dog repeller, hiking poles and for visibility and fun.

&#9654; What bikes are you riding?
- We rode 26\" aluminum mountain bikes with suspenstion forks with a rather classic, pannier-based setup.

&#9654; Where did you buy your bikes?
- The black bike was bought new in a local shop in Germany and the other one (blue) on ebay.

&#9654; How many flat tires did you have?
- Actually, we only had three flat tires (all in David's back wheel). We think that we had really good tires and that you are a lot less likely to get punctures when you are in the countryside.

&#9654; Did you have problems with your bikes/other gear?
- Of course, we had some problems but indeed nothing to serious. For example, our hubs (standard shimano hubs, see in our gear list..) all broke one after another. And after 10.000 km David's chain and gear were all worn through which is no surprise.

&#9654; Did you send stuff back home?
- We sent a package home from Cusco, Peru. It contained mostly stuff that we bought there as Chrismas presents or souvenirs but also some of our original gear: For instance, we used to carry two power banks but had never used both. In addition, we got rid of some rarely used cloth.

&#9654; What was most useful/useless?
- In one item probably a spare derailleur hanger is simultaneously the most useful AND most useless thing to carry: As long as you don't need it, it is utterly useless but if your current hanger breaks you won't find the exact spare part anywhere in South America.

- In two items: 

&#9654; What did you miss most?
- Apart from family and friends, probably good bread. Just a real dense intergal bread.

&#9654; How much money did you spend?
- All in all, around 3000 &euro; per person (including flights). More details are found on our [Expenses](/resources/expenses.html) page.

&#9654; How do you pay for your travel?
- We worked while studying and tried to spend as less as possible: Instead of buying high-end bicycles, we decided to ride used and robust mountain bikes.

&#9654; How much did your bikes cost?
- The black cube (Jo's bike) is actually David's mountainbike and was bought almost 10 years ago for around 700-800 &euro;. We bought the blue cube bike (David's bike) for more or less 200 &euro; used.
