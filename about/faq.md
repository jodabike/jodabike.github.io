&#9654; Where are you from?

&nbsp; &bull; We live in the South of Germany.

- From where to where are you riding?
We went form Quito (Ecuador) to Ushuaia (Argentina).

- What is your job?
We just finished our studies and hence had time for the trip.

- Why do you carry sticks?
Our (mostly) bamboo stick are multipurpose tools: We use them as bike stands, car spacer, dog repeller, hiking poles and for visibility and fun.

- How many kilometers/hours do you ride per day?
These numbers depend a lot on slope and road quality: In average we rode around 50km a day in 6-12h.

No, only this blog due to privacy concerns related with facebook products.

- Do your legs/butts hurt?
Our legs got quickly used to cycling everyday, however hiking detours sometimes lead to sore muscles. We had well suiting saddles that were adjusted properly which is really important. Although this minimizes any butt pain, e.g. washboard roads could still be quite painful.

- Where do you sleep?
Most of the times we just wild camped in our tent. Sometimes in bigger towns we stayed at hostels, also to shower once in a while :D.
