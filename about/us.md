#About us

We are Johanna and David from Germany and both finished our studies in spring 2019. Hence, we both had some free time and saved money to spend on exploring the world before jumping into work life.


###Jo about David:
David is a passionate cyclist and if it would have been up to him, we would have cycled all the way from Alaska to Ushuaia. He is an eager trip planner and full of curiosity and great ideas for new adventures. During a variety of former bike tours, David gathered a lot of helpful experience and I am always glad to have such a competent and reliant partner by my side.

###David about Jo:
Johanna became a passionate cyclist after she overcame initial doubts during several smaller biketours in Europe. She is very open-minded and is keen to explore the world without ever loosing touch to friends and relatives back home. Furthermore, she started this blog and fills it with its picturerich posts.
