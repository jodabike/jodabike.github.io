*July 3 - July 10*

We rode about 25 km from Marcar√° to Huaraz in the morning and checked in in a nice hostel with very friendly owners. We wanted to take a little break in this city after more than 2000 km of cycling.

In the afternoon, we went shopping for a new jacket for Jo and actually found a nice and cheap second hand jacket that even fits with the fleece inlay from her old one. :)

On Thursday, we had breakfast in a cafe with yogurt, fruits and cereals which was a nice change from the bread we usually have.

Unfortunately, Jo had had some bad stomach cramps during the past view nights, so we spent the next morning in a hospital nearby to get that checked out (instead of going for a hike which was our actual plan for that day). The examination went surprisingly well and fast and it turned out, that it is a bacterial infection. It should be cured soon.

On Saturday, we cleaned our bikes, put some oil on the chains and checked the screws after all these shaky roads.

And we wandered through the colorful city again.

It was a beautiful ride, but in his way back, David noticed that his back wheel did not roll properly anymore. Some horses also found that pretty strange.

Hence, we went to Arturo's bike shop on Tuesday to fix that problem. David had to carry the bike, because the back wheel was almost totally blocked.

We had to wait for some bike parts, so went to the archaeological museum in the afternoon.

We returned to the bike shop in the early evening, enjoying the good view on the mountains on our way.

And luckily, Arturo and his colleague were able to fix the wheel!

Arturo also was extremely friendly and showed us his bike with a fancy self-made luggage carrier.

So, somehow, our stay in Huaraz got longer and longer even though we had planned to leave the city by Sunday. On the one hand, we were really happy that all these things happened to us in such a big city, where we could easily buy a new jacket, see a doctor and find help in a bike shop. But on the other hand, it also felt a bit like this city did not want to let us go. :D Hence, we were happy that Jo finally felt better after she decided to take some antibiotics and we could take off on Wednesday.
