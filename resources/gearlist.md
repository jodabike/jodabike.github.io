# Gear list

We tried to compile a (hopefully) complete list of all the gear that we carry. The list is structured in categories and the items of each section are roughly ordered by importance. Brackets indicate unused or replaced items. An asterisk marks a later added piece of equipment and things that we plan to carry in future are preceded by two asterisks.

Further, we reviewed some of our equipment with the classic traffic light system (green: good, orange: ok, red: bad). Each reviewed item links directly to details in our gear review post.

The full list is [here](https://jodabike.github.io/resources/downloads/gearList.txt) available as compact text file for saving or printing.
