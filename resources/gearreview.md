# Gear Review

## Sleeping bags and mats

We came across a variety of different climates and hence had to find some tradeoff between too warm and heavy or too light and cold sleeping bags. Finally, we decided to use the down sleeping bags which we already owned (also for money reasons). Those were rated to reach as low as -1 &deg; C (comfort). In general, we were very happy with this solution since down sleeping bags are quite light and compact.

However, David's sleeping bag was heavily used already and had lost some filling. As a result, he experienced a few cold nights when we camped very high. This led us to buy some sheets of colorful Peruvian fabric (see Fig. below) which we wrapped around the sleeping bag for the coldest nights.

After all, this solution worked quite well and we got to keep some more of this amazing Peruvian fabric! Depending on the climate, on the next journey we might invest a little bit more into our sleeping bags...

Concerning sleeping mats, we did not find the optimal solution yet. David owns a Thermarest Prolite Plus Rest which is overall ok but nothing great. We always had some problems with holes (although we used the mat inside the tent only). And on top of that: did anyone ever explain Thermarest how a valve functions? No, seriously.. all Thermarest mats we know, do not have an actual valve that holds air in if you release the pressure while filling the mat. This is indeed very annoying, especially if you use this product literally everyday at high altitudes. Jo originally carried an Exped SIM 3.8M which was fine in the beginning. It came with a real valve and hence was easy to inflate. However, one day without prior warning, this matress just lost its inner structure. This means, from a flat rectancular shape it evolved quickly to a ballon. We think that somehow the matress was glued in its interior to hold its shape and that this glue just gave up. Eventually, we bought a new one (Doite Colchoneta CrosTec) in Chile which did fine on the last month. But this one also came without proper valve. 


## Tent

We used an old two-person Marmot tent named Twilight 2p. This piece of hardware served us extremely well! The tent was bought approximately
15 years ago and has been used heavily: It has been on all continents but Antarctica and Australia and was set up now more than a thousand times in literally any climate. It endured snowstorms, thunderstorms, Patagonian down-under rain, freezing temperatures, high UV-radiation and attacking cows. Definitely highly recommended!

## Clothes

For cold times and rainy days David bought a used Halti ski jacket which served him well. However, as usual, the weak spot was the zipper which made some problems during the last month. Furthermore, we used standard gloves. But we think it might be quite useful to have at least one pair of gloves which is capable of operating a touch screen. This may really help if you are navigating with a smartphone in cold weather!

As an everyday sweater, David used an Ortovox zipper jacket with merino lining which was very comfortable to wear. However, UV-Radiation attacked the material heavily leading to some cuts. Furthermore, David wore pretty much everyday Arcterix climbing pants. These also served him extremely well. Although, they were not waterproof, they were good for rainy days as well since they dry very fast.

With the shoes we wore we were not so lucky. Indeed, Davids shoes started falling apart during the last months. He wore light QC Trailrunning shoes, but the material just seemed too thin and not properly suited for 'real' outdoor adventures. One advantage though was that these shoes dried quite fast. Jo on the other hand wore more proper low hiking shoes made by Lowa. These were of much better quality and actually lasted without problems till the end. However, for cycling also these shoes did not seem optimal. They were relatively heavy and it took ages to dry them. From what we observed on other bikes, Salomon hiking/running shoes seemed to be more suitable.

Finally, Jo was very satisfied with her merino sports bra since it dried quite fast and never felt uncomfortable cold as compared to polyester. Furthermore, David wore an old Uvex helmet which lasted him already over 15 years. So these seem to be of quite good quality as well.


## Cooking

To supply ourselves with fresh and clean water everyday, we relied on a water filter. Especially in Peru and Bolivia water sources may be infected with parasites such as Giardia or bacteria. Most of the other cyclists we met also relied on a filter. However, it seemed that our filter had the advantage that it actually included a pump system rather than just waiting for gravity to push the water through. In particular, we used the Katadyn Hiker Pro which allowed us to filter all our water bottles in around 5 minutes.

For cooking, we opted for a Trangia alcohol burner in combination with a Trangia Triangle as stand and wind shelter. Especially for this topic we conducted a lot of research in advance. Before this tour we always used a Primus gas stove which relied on screwable cartridges. As we were told in advance that these cartridges are quite hard to find in South America, we narrowed our choices down to gasoline or alcohol as possible fuels.

The problem with gasoline stoves seems to be the quality of available fuel: Many other cyclists reported blocked gas valves or hoses. And on top of that, even no name copies of these stoves are quite expensive. Hence we decided for a super cheap, simple and light alcohol burner. And indeed this system fully convinced us: Alcohol is literally available everywhere, the stove has no parts that could possibly be clogged and moreover, it is super efficient. One liter of alcohol lasted us easily over a month.

All in all, probably the most important aspect of stove efficiency, regardless of the particular system, is wind shelter. Always make sure that you block the wind as much as possible and carry a suited windshield for the stove. We made the experience that this reduces fuel consumption up to a factor of three.

In addition, we did not carry plates or bows for eating. Instead we used the pot which we already had from a Primus Eta Power light. This pot was quite useful as it allowed to drain hot water from pasta through its lid. But we are sure that there are many camping pots with this feature. We were just really lucky that this particular pot exactly fitted with the Trangia triangle.

Originally, we used an original Trangia 1l fuel bottle to carry our alcohol. However, from the beginning on we realized that it was leaking and hence we replaced it by a regular PET bottle which did absolutely fine.



## Hygiene

Jo's portable urination device, Unigear, made life so much easier for her. If there was no hidden spot to squat down and pee, if it was cold or if there were moskitos around, it was always a great relief to be able to pee while standing without having to pull the pants down. 


## Electronics

While we were planning the trip, we were considering to carry a computer as well. We thought this would make picture backup, blogging or communication easier. However, due to weight reasons we abandoned this idea and relied instead on our smartphones. In fact, it turned out that most of the tasks were quite easily possible on cell phones too. In particular, we carried two iPhone SE with 128 GB for enough picture storage. For example, in order to transfer and upload our camera pictures, we used an SD to iPhone adapter and hence were able to import the data onto our phones and upload them if desired. Also blogging was straightforward with our phones, David even managed to design and draw our logo on his cell phone. So all in all, we totally recommend not to carry a computer as it will save a lot of weight and of course it's one valuable less that you have to worry about.

Furthermore, we recommend to look out for local SIM cards. In the beginning, we solely used public or hostel wifi which was fine for Ecuador and Peru as it is found quite easily there. In Bolivia, the situation changed quite a bit, thus we decided to purchase a local SIM card to access the internet (in this particular country make sure to buy ENTEL and NOT TIGO). In general, it probably depends on where and how you travel but we concluded for us that it pays off to get one.

To take photos, we carried a Panasonic Lumix DMC-G6, mostly with its standard 14-42 zoom lens. We decided for this mirrorless system due to its smaller size and weight in favor of a Canon EOS 50D. In conclusion, we think that this camera served us quite well and was appropriate for most situations. During a chest-deep rivercrossing, the camera took a bath as David slipped with his bike on his back. But after drying with rice and sunlight, we managed to make it work again. But for the next trip, we will definitely bring an even better zoom lens, especially to capture animals.

Our camera setup further included a fixed lens (1:1.7) which was mostly used for portaits. In additon, we used a double USB charger to charge the three camera batteries that we carried. This allowed us to charge all our electronic devices via USB which is very conveinient in our opinion. 

Furthermore, we also used rechargable head torches with Li-ion batteries, for example the Petzl Arctic Core. In order to recharge all our devices, we relied on an Anker douple USB charger (make sure to get one with at least 2A per port as this governs the charging speed). Or if now external power was available, we had an Anker Power Core 20100mAh powerbank which lasted us up to two weeks. Additionally, we also used a no name ultralight solar panel which emitted more power than we expected, but eventually its plug broke.

Finally, we carried as well a Spot GPS satellite tracker, mostly to calm our parents. We set it up in a manner that it sent a position signal every hour while activated via satellite. However, it turned out that although the device itself cofirmed a transmitted postion signal (green LED) that nothing was actually sent in most cases. After all, around 2 to 3 position signals were successfully transmitted everyday (of expected 8-12). This means that if you actually need a reliable GPS satellite tracker, you should not get this one. Another disadvantage is, that this device needs 4 AAA batteries and cannot be recharged via USB. Eventually, a crew member of a boat passage we had to take (Lago O'higgins) dropped it into the lake and it was lost.

In order to protect most of our electronic devices from water, we used a small 2l dry bag which we found quite useful. Another thing to mention is that we eventually bought a cheap bluetooth soundbox to listen to podcasts and music while riding rather monotonous streches. An even better solution might be to pair two small boxes via bluetooth if you are travelling together, then you do not need to ride in parallel while listening. But we did not try that out yet..

## Documents and Cards

Money is always a delicate topic. No one wants to carry tons of cash around. Luckily nowadays, this can be easily avoided by using international credit cards. We each had free DKB VISA credit cards which allow for free withdrawl worldwide. You just have to be careful that local ATM do not charge you a fee. In all countries but Argentina, we also managed to find such ATMs (see <a href="resources/tips.html">Tips</a>). So we can indeed highly recommend this.

One downside is that with the introduction of stricter banking laws for EU, one needs a TAN code to access the respective online banking portal. This codes can either be generated via an online smartphone app or by the use of a TAN generator in combination with a bank card. The major disadvantage of the first method is that if someone obtains physical or even just virtual access to your phone, he might be able to steal your account. Furthermore, you are required to always have quite new smartphones as on older devices the app's current version is usually not supported. Hence, we decided to carry a TAN generator although this meant to have even one device more. In our case, we were unlucky as the generator broke and we were unable to access our accounts. So after all, none of the possible solutions seemed perfect. But we will probably stick to a TAN generator on our next trip.
