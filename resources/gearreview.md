# Gear Review

## Sleeping bags

We came across quite a variety of different climates and hence had to find some tradeoff between too warm and heavy or too light and cold sleeping bags. Finally, we decided to use the down sleeping bags which we already owned (also for money reasons). Those were rated to reach as low as -1 &deg; C (comfort). In general, we were very happy with this solution since down sleeping bags are quite light and compact.

However, David's sleeping bag was quite heavily used already and had lost some filling. As a result, he experienced a few cold nights when we camped very high. This led us to buy some sheets of colorful Peruvian fabric (see Fig. below) which we wrapped around the sleeping bag for the coldest nights.

After all, this solution worked quite well and we got to keep some more of this amazing Peruvian fabric! Depending on the climate, on the next journey we might invest a little bit more into our sleeping bags...


## Tent

We used an old two-person Marmot tent named Twilight 2p. This piece of hardware served us extremely well! The tent was bought approximately
15 years ago and has been used heavily: It has been on all continents but Antarctica and Australia and was set up now more than a thousand times in literally any climate. It endured snowstorms, thunderstorms, Patagonian down-under rain, freezing temperatures, high UV-radiation and attacking cows. Definitely highly recommended!

## Clothes

For cold times and rainy days David bought a used Halti ski jacket which served him well. However as usual the weak spot was the zipper which made some problems during the last month.

As an everyday sweater, David used an Ortovox zipper jacket with merino lining which was very comfortable to wear. However, UV-Radiation attacked the material heavily leading to some cuts. Furthermore, David wore pretty much everyday Arcterix climbing pants. These also served him extremely well. Although, they were not waterproof, they were good for rainy days as well since they dry very fast.

With the shoes we wore we were not so lucky. Indeed, Davids shoes started falling apart during the last months. He wore light QC Trailrunning shoes, but the material just seemed too thin and not properly suited for 'real' outdoor adventures. One advantage though was that these shoes dried quite fast. Jo on the other hand wore more proper low hiking shoes made by Lowa. These were of much better quality and actually lasted without problems till the end. However, for cycling also these shoes did not seem optimal. They were relatively heavy and it took ages to dry them. From what we observed on other bikes, Salomon hiking/running shoes seemed to be more suitable.

Finally, Jo was very satisfied with her merino sports bra since it dried quite fast and never felt uncomfortable cold as compared to polyester. Furthermore, David wore an old Uvex helmet which lasted him already over 15 years. So these seem to be of quite good quality as well.


## Cooking

To supply ourselves with fresh and clean water everyday, we relied on a water filter. Especially in Peru and Bolivia water sources may be infected with parasites such as Giadira or bacteria. Most of the other cyclist we met also relied on a filter. However, it seemed that our filter had the advantage that it actually included a pump system rather than just on gravity to push the water through. In particular, we used the Katadyn Hiker Pro which allowed us to filter all our water bottles in around 5 minutes.

For cooking, we opted for a Trangia alcohol burner in combination with a Trangia Triangle as stand and wind shelter. Especially for this topic we conducted a lot of research in advance. Before this tour we always used a Primus gas stove which relied on screwable cartridges. As we were told in advance that these cartridges are quite hard to find in South America, we narrowed our choices down to gasoline or alcohol as possible fuels.

The problem with gasoline stoves seems to be the quality of available fuel: Many other cyclists reported blocked gas valves or hoses. And on top of that, even no name copies of these stoves are quite expensive. Hence we decided for a super cheap, simple and light alcohol burner. And indeed this system fully convinced us: Alcohol is literally available everywhere, the stove has no parts that could possibly be clogged and moreover it is super efficient. One liter of alcohol lasted us easily over a month.

All in all, probably the most important aspect of stove efficiency, regardless of the particular system, is wind shelter. Always make sure that you block the wind as much as possible and carry a suited windshield for the stove. We made the experience that this reduces fuel consumption up to a factor of three.

In addition, we did not carry plates or bows for eating. Instead we used the pot which we already had from a Primus Eta Power light. This pot was quite useful as it allowed to drain hot water from pasta through its lid. But we are sure that there are many camping pots with this feature. We were just really lucky that this particular pot exactly fitted with the Trangia triangle.

Originally, we used an original Trangia 1l fuel bottle to carry our alcohol. However, from the beginning on we realized that it was leaking and hence we replaced it by a regular PET bottle which did absolutely fine.
