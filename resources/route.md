# Route

Before we left, we had spend quite some time on planning our trip. We did not plan everything in detail but we had some rough idea and sections that we really liked to ride. Our main inpriation came form [Dan and Gina](https://fatcycling.wordpress.com) who rode 2015-16 from Mexico to Ushuaia on Fatbike. In addition, we also adopted some streches of [Nicholas Gault](https://nicholasgault.com) who completed his Alaska to Argentina goal on dirt roads in 2017. Other than that there are some interesting routes on [Bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com) and [Andes by Bike](https://andesbybike.com/).

In detail, the exact routing depended on local conditions, tips by other cyclists or jsut by trying out things. All in all, we ended up with this track:
