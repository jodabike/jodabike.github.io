# Tips and Hints

While we were travelling, we were especially thankful for all the infos and tips that we got from fellow cyclist, backpackers or other people. So we decided to summarize our experience as well for future explorers. Due to the great geographical, climatic and cultural variance along the South America from the Equator to Patagonia, we decided to divide our tour tips into four sections corresponding to their respective countries or regions. Hope it helps!

## <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Flag_of_Ecuador.svg" alt="Flag of Ecuador" width="50"> <span>&nbsp;</span> Ecuador

#### Food

*Favorites:* Cevichocho (Streetfood), Corncobs with homemade Mayo (Streetfood on route to Chimborazo), Croissants with manja blanca (sweet caramel like filling), Granadilla (Similar to maracuya but sweeter).

*Restaurants:* Menu for 2-3eur (completo) includes Starter (usually chicken soup), Secondo (meat with rice) and drink (for example sweet tea or corn drink with refills).

*Cooking:* Basic supplies are found in all small tiendas, often fruits and veggies as well. In cities or larger villages, we'd recommend to search for the local market which usually provides the full range of fruits and vegetables for the lowest price. Alcohol (96%, 0.5l cost ~4usd) for our stove was available in pharmacies.

*Water:* We carry a water filter with us. However, we drank almost all tap water unfiltered in Ecuador an had no problems. Probably, we also had some luck. Better filter if you have one!


#### Bike

*Shops/Tools:* Bikeshops in all major cities with many Shimano and general spare parts.

*Roads:* The Panamericana sees a lot of traffic around cities but is quiet in the countryside. It usually features a wide shoulder for biking. The Backroads we took were of very variable quality but in general all rideable. However be careful during rainy season many may turn into unridable mud holes.

#### Nights

*Wild Camping:* Generally it is no problem to find a good and quiet campspot anywhere away from the major cities. Although we always felt safe, we'd recommend to camp out of sight of traffic/population in order to avoid disturbance. The application iOverlander might be helpful to find a campspot or a hostel.

*Accommodations:* Are found in all cities and often also in small villages. We paid around 15-20eur for a matrimonial room usually with wifi, a private bathroom and hot shower. The latter are most of the times heated electrically and the cable management might be rather adventurous.. So be careful!


#### Money (USD)

*Withdrawal:* We were able to withdraw money for free at "Banco de Guayaquil" and "Banco de Loja" with our DKB VISA card. But we heard that many other ATMs are as well free of charge. However some banks like "Scotiabank" were charging a small fee (~5usd). ATMs are found in all cities.

*Exchange:* Currency change at the border to Peru (La Balsa) was no problem. We even got a fair rate. If you enter Peru, it might be helpful to keep some backup dollars for emergencies.


#### Medicine and Hygiene

*Hospitals:* In all big cities are real hospitals, in villages we saw some smaller 'Centros de Salud'. Since we luckily did not have to visit any we don't know further details. Pharmacies are also available in all cities. You can directly purchase most (maybe all?) medicine. Sunblock and alcohol is also found there.


#### Weather

Due to its proximity to the equator (who would have guessed?!) Ecuador features not the classical four seasons but a rainy and a dry season (mid June to October). For biking, especially in the mountains, we highly recommend the dry season: We started our trip end of May and had quite some cold and wet days. Be prepared for four seasons a day.


#### Communication

We highly recommend at least basic Spanish skills (Grammar does not matter). It is a real door-opener and makes things just a lot easier. Now and then you will find someone who speaks English.

- Friendly and helpful Bomberos
- Green vegetation almost everywhere

## <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Flag_of_Peru_%28state%29.svg" width="50"> <span>&nbsp;</span> Peru

#### Food

*Favorites:* Sopa de Leche (vegetarian cream soup in Ica), Ocas (Peruvian potato similar to sweet potatoes), Troucha frita (locally fished trout), Lucuma yogurt drink (tastes a little like coconut.. only better).

*Restaurants:* Serve Menus for around 5sol (ca. 1eur) with starter soup, secondo and drink (called aguita). The Peruvians' favorite dish seems to be rice with chicken which is found literally everywhere.

*Cooking:* Similar situation like in Ecuador. Fruits and vegetables are best purchased at the local markets, other basic supplies in tiendas and if you want something special or more European, you'll have to go to a more expensive supermarket found in major cities. We were able to purchase alcohol (0.5l cost ~1eur) for our stove at pharmacies.

*Water:* After some minor stomach problems and recommendations of other cyclists, we decided to filter from now on all water. Although we did this without exception, Jo had some stomach problems in Huaraz and David even had to go to the hospital in Abancay. This might have been water unrelated, but just filter the tap water. It will save you quite some trouble.

#### Bike

*Shops/Tools:* In general, bike shops are less abundant than in Ecuador. However, we were able to find pretty much all spare parts (or some workaround) that we needed. Bike shops are rarely found in smaller villages but sometimes one of the many llantarias (Tire repairmen) or car mechanics is just as good. We'd recommend to carry bicycle specific tools with you (chain tool, spare spokes, inner tube..).

</figure>

*Roads:* Peruvians know how to build roads! And this skill is very necessary because the part we cycled consisted pretty much only of steep mountainsides. All major roads and most of the back roads never exceed an incline of 5%. Whenever possible roads avoid unnecessary climbing/downhill and keep a constant slope. In addition most of the main highways are paved (too much traffic was only a problem on the coastal Panamericana) and even the surface of many backroads is quite smooth and bumpless. If you decide to do some hike-a-bike sections (e.g. the Salkantay trail) you will know why the Incas never used wheels, although they knew the principle.


#### Nights

*Wild Camping:* Just as straightforward as in Ecuador, sometimes even easier (especially if you know Spanish). Many times we could stay at the central square of small villages (ask first if you are not invited by locals already..) or camp on a village's soccer field. Be prepared for cold nights if you decide to visit the high mountains. We use sleeping bags rated for -1Â°C but this is rather ambiguous (aka sometimes cold).

*Accommodations:* Are cheaper than in Ecuador, the usual price for a matrimonial room was about 20-30sol (~5-7eur). We really recommend to test promised hot showers before paying, sometimes hot water never materializes. Wifi is not as abundant as in Ecuador, however still available in many places. We did not have mobile Internet and had no problems. Again we highly recommend the application iOverlander for helpful and honest reviews of many places.


#### Money (PEN aka sol)

*Withdrawal:* The only free ATMs that reliably worked with our DKB VISA card were by the "Banco de la Nacion". This seems to be the main bank in Peru and ATMs are usually found next to central square (Plaza de Armas), even in many smaller villages. The banks are mostly mapped on OpenStreetMap (e.g. found in Apps like Maps.Me or MapOut).

*Exchange:* In almost all banks it is possible to change USD to PEN or vice versa. So if you carry some backup dollars, you are good in case of sudden needs. When we exited Peru at Tilali (north shore of Lago Titicaca), the official exchange bureau was closed. However, we were able to exchange some sols to Bolivianos at a tienda. Finally, we could exchange the rest at another tienda in the first village in Bolivia (Puerto Acosta).


#### Medicine and Hygiene

*Hospitals:* Are found in all cities. Jo went due to stomach problems to the hospital in Huaraz. We had to wait half a day to see a doctor. But overall the service was good and professional. The cost was about 10eur. The second time we went was in Cuahurasi (close to Abancay) where we were both treated for stomach problems again. In both occasions the doctors prescribed strong antibiotics which is in Germany uncommon. Eventually, we decided not to take them after we read further information online. However, we also got some pain medicine and electrolyte solution which really helped. We think the best is to have contact to a doctor in your home country before you blindly take all the medicine that is prescribed here.

*Toilets:* Public toilets and cheaper hostel toilets (usually shared bathroom) don't have toilet paper. But as a long distance cyclist you are probably carrying toilet paper anyway. And don't throw it in the bowl.


#### Weather

Just as in Ecuador the climate here is dominated by a dry (mid May to October) and rainy season. Again, we highly recommend to bike during the dry season for obvious reasons. It might be even quite dangerous during the rainy season due to many rock and landslides, especially on steep back roads. Also be prepared for someone cold nights: at over 3500-4000m there are always subzero temperatures at night.

#### Communication

Spanish is pretty much mandatory here. English speakers were definitely the exception for us. In order to improve our Spanish and obtain closer insights we actually never spoke English. Furthermore, in remoter villages even Spanish or Castellano (how it's called there) might not be the native language. In fact, especially older people prefer to speak Quechua, the indigenous language of the Inca and Andean people. For example "ari" means yes and "mana" no.

*Hola Gringo:* As an European or North American you will quickly notice that folks out there call you "Gringo" or " Gringa". It's some friendly greeting like "Mister"...

- Gifted ocas in Conchucos
- Portichuelo de Llanganuco, Huaraz and Cordillera Blanca
- Pastoruri pass
- Bosque de Piedras before Junin
- Huacachina Oasis (although very touristic well worth a sight, it seems to be the Sahara desert)
- Salkantay trail to Machu Picchu (if you are not into carrying your bike for two days, you can also do this as a hike-without-a-bike)
- School of disabled kids in Cusco
- Meeting Hannah and Marius close to Lago Titicaca

## <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Flag_of_Bolivia_%28state%29.svg" width="50"> <span>&nbsp;</span> Bolivia

#### Food

*Favorites:* Asado de Alpaca (Alpaca steak served in the mountains), Various self-caught fishes of Rio Beni, Long bean-like jungle fruit, Queso frito.

*Restaurants:* Although Bolivia is overall cheaper than Peru, Restaurants tend to be a little more expensive: The average Menu cost us between 10 and 15bob (2-3eur). Sometimes we received a starter soup, sometimes the "secondo" first and then the soup for some reason. Everything was quite tasty, it seems that the Peruvian chicken is gradually replaced by Llama and Alpaca meat the further South you go.

*Cooking:* Again, we were looking for small tiendas or local markets. In remote places it might be hard to find fruits and vegetables. However, after a bit of searching, we usually found what we needed. Fortunately, it is quite easy to find alcohol almost everywhere: Just look for "Ceibo" which is 96%-alcohol meant for drinking!

*Water:* Just as in Peru, we always filtered all tap water. We did not have any problems!


#### Bike

*Shops/Tools:* Are only available in major cities like La Paz. So bring your own spare parts and tools. If you are lucky a car mechanic might be able to help you.

*Roads:* Pavement in Bolivia is a lot rarer than in the previous two countries. Basically only major highways are paved. Out of the 1500km we rode in Bolivia only ca. 200km were paved. Dirt roads are of very variable quality but in general rideable. Especially in the huge flats of the Altiplano or along the Lagunas Route, the road surface is quite bad: Usually a washboard like structure is alternated with unridable sandy stretches of a few meters. In addition, also the Salar de Uyuni was a little more bumpy than we expected, but no problem to ride.


#### Nights

*Wild camping:* Spots are easily found anywhere. Moreover it seemed to us that the people out here are super friendly and hospitable (probably also because our Spanish had improved quite a lot since we started): We were invited more than ever before to sleep in churches, for a lunch or dinner or just to pitch the tent next to some house.

*Accommodations:* Overall the standard of living is a little bit lower than in Peru. WiFi was an absolute exception and many hostels charge extra for (hot/cold) showers. In average. We paid around 60-80bol (8-10eur) for a matrimonial room.


#### Money (Bolivanos aka Bols or pesos)

*Withdrawal:* ATMs are rare and only found in major cities. So plan carefully. In Guanay, we had to exchange some backup dollars as we ran out of money. We could withdraw for free at the main bank called "Banco Union". We think exchange of and to USD is possible at most banks but most don't have ATMs. Western Union was also available at many places but we did not use it.

*Exchange:* As before, we recommend some backup dollars which can be exchanged in many places. We finally crossed into Chile at a very remote border (Lagunas Route) and were not able to exchange Bolivanos to Chilean pesos at the Bolivian side. However, we found a Tienda in San Pedro offering a quite good rate (1:100 as opposed to the usually offered 1:80 in the official "Casas de Cambio"). Furthermore, be careful: people told us there is a lot of false money in circulation. So better check safety features such as watermarks or silver stripes. However, there are as well about three different looking generations of real bills in circulation.


#### Medicine and Hygiene

*Hospitals:* Seem to be a lot rarer than in Peru. Probably count only on big cities. Luckily, we did not have to visit any.

*Toilets:* Always bring your own paper and throw it in the bin.


#### Weather

The usual rainy and dry (May to November) season game. Overall the weather during our stay seemed a little more stable and reliable as in Ecuador or Peru. We only had one Day of heavy rain here while we were in the jungle. But if you decide to travel the high Andes (up to 5000m) be prepared for heavy winds (80-100km/h), freezing nights (-20Â°C) and very high UV radiation (Sunburn in 5min).


#### Communication

Spanish is in our opinion a must if you do not stick to La Paz or other metropoles. Especially when we descended into the Yungas jungle, there were many villages of only Quechua speaking locals. But we made it work with hands and feet.


#### Personal Highlights

- Descend to the Yungas Jungle on unknown roads
- Boat Tour from Mapiri to Rurrenabaque
- Teleferico (calble car) in La Paz
- Hot spring at Sajama volcano
- Salar de Uyuni
- Lagunas Route

## <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Flag_of_Argentina_and_Chile.png" width="60"> <span>&nbsp;</span> Patagonia (Chile & Argentina)


#### Food

*Favorites:* Nalca

*Restaurants:* In general, Restaurants are a lot more expensive in Patagonia and do not offer a complete Menus but rather seperate dishes. As a result, we didn't eat as much in restaurants as before. 

*Cooking:* All kind of food seems to be widely available. In fact, supermarkets are found often even in smaller towns and offer groceries, bread and vegetables usually. Similar to Europe, supermarkets tend to be a little bit cheaper than smaller individual stores. However, we noticed that prices in smaller stores may vary significantly. For instance, sometimes we found cheaper chocolate in smaller stores. Farmacies offered alcohol for our stove. 

*Water:* Drinking water never was a real problem in (western) Patagonia. Due to its abundant rainfall and its low population density, Patagonia offers clean streams to fill your bottles around every corner. In fact, we stopped filtering water and did not have any problems. However, for Tierra del Fuego (southern island) we filtered our water again due to its Giadira-spreading beaver population. 


#### Bike

*Shops/Tools:* Along the Carretera Austral, bikeshops are found in many towns since the road is very popular among cyclists. On the Argentinian side, one has to rely on the major cities such as El Calafate or Rio Grande.
